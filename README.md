EoaNB Development Repository

This repository is for sharing and cooperating with the process of developing EoaNB.
If you wish to support the development and join the team, join our Discord server and create an application. All members with the role Curia are granted access to the repository, and are given one 'Vicarius', or a team.
All Vicarii are only allowed to push content to their Vicarius branch, and content on the branch is updated to the master branch after error checks. PLEASE do not push content you think is unstable or incomplete to the Vicarius branch. If you think procedural development is crucial for your project, create a new branch ONLY AFTER requesting it via Discord/GitHub.

If you do not wish to apply as a dev, you are free to fork the repository and modify it, redistribute it and privately use it, but the content of EoaNB is licensed under the GNU General Public License 3.0, which means you have to alert that what you're redistributing is a modified version of EoaNB.
We also do not tolerate redistribution of the components of EoaNB that are our creations without special permission.
