 DCI_decision_category:0 "Detrimental Colonial Impact"
 DCI_decision_category_desc:0 "§YImpact of Colonialism:§!\n§gRacial supremacy and ideas similar to the "White Man's Burden" have plagued the judgement of officials, advisors, companies, or politicians working within colonies or influenced nations. Often this leads to corruption within the local government and the marginalized group being ostracized from their politics or given second class citizenship. In some affected govermnents, acts of violence or discrimination are done against these marginalized groups.\n\nOver the years these actions have sowed deep divides between the ruling and marginalized classes within society. Acts to undo the Detrimental Impacts of Colonialism should be made to prevent further unintended consequences.§!""
