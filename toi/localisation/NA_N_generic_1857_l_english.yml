nativeindustrial.3.d:0 "Wilson Red-Fox was the chief of a large town in south dakota, notable for two things: weighing as much as a small horse and being a hobby chemist who experimented with synthesizing chemicals in his spare time with books he had found whilst raiding settlers. He is now considered an era-defining genius by many, having developed the Wilson Process, a method of extracting celluloid polymers from corn and wheat agricultural waste. His chemical business now manufactures everything from industrial pesticides to plastics and synthetic rubbers."

nativeindustrial.4.d:0 "William 'Big Billy' Watts was born a slave and grew up a slave. But, in the chaos of the collapse of the confederation he was able to escape to Texas, where he started a small drilling well with what little he had in the budding oil industry. Now, he owns fields of wells and several large prototype refineries. One of the true rags-to-riches stories, palm petro-chemical specialises in petroleum chemistr and resource recovery, branching out from oil into mineral and lumber resources too."

nativeindustrial.5.d:0 "The golden tyre company didn't start making tyres, they started making gloves for the new generation of factory workers and builders. However, these were never popular with workmen as the vulcanised rubber was stiff and cracked with use. This rubber, with the advent of the motor vehicle, proved useful for making hard-wearing road tyres useful for military and agricultural settings."

Our architects have drawn up plans for a metropolis that will represent our new aesthetic of 'Native Gothic' and showcase our new technical advancements to the watching world. This city will be built around a central circus 2km in diameter, within which will be contained the world's largest totem pole and area of worship, a collosal offering to our gods and ancestors, and an incredible monument to our power and wealth. The only question that remains, is whether we should rename the city or keep the old one?"

nativepolitical.6.d:0 "There was a flash, as the bomb went off on the range. It was a new guidance system they were testing, some kind of gyroscope. The shamans in their white coats and overalls stood shoulder to shoulder with generals and chiefs. One evening, long ago, an elderly Cherokee Brave told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, 'My son, there is a battle between two wolves inside us all.  One is evil.  It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other wolf is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.' The grandson thought abut it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, 'Which wolf wins?' The old Cherokee simply replied, 'The one you feed.' There was a low drone as the test plane zipped overhead, and a crackle on the radio of the pilot asking for his next orders. The general gave the go-ahead and moments later the second bomb touched down on the range. There was a crack, ad then a flash."

nativemilitary.3.t:0 "The Wendigo Battalion"
nativemilitary.3.d:0 "A wendigo, is an evil spirit which originates from the darkest folklore of this land. The Wendigo is often said to be a malevolent spirit, sometimes depicted as a creature with human-like characteristics, which possesses human beings. It is known to invoke feelings of insatiable greed/hunger in men, the desire to cannibalize other humans, as well as the propensity to commit murder in those that fall under its influence. The Wendigo is gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looks like a skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it has are tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from decay of the flesh, and it gives off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption. This terrible creature stalks in the night, capturing an consuming it's prey, and is truly a figure to be feared. But it's just a myth, right? The truth is, stranger than fiction. These 'wendigo' are not mythical ravenous man-eating monsters, but men, dressed all in black, who hunt in the night. A battalion of soldiers specially trained in the mastery of night-fighting and hunting, and sworn to fight for their people until the very bitter end. These stalkers can track american troops for days, weeks even, calculating their number and understanding their behavior by what they leave behind. They can pull men from their tends, sabotage stores, release horses to run, and cause untold chaos behind enemy lines. Truly, the most feared monster here is in fact man."
