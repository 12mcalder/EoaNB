 acw_beckenridge.1.d:0 "The results of the 1860 Elections delivered great shock across the nation as Southern Democrat John C. Beckenridge squeaked to victory. With insurmountable tensions in sight, President-Elect Beckenridge has formally announced that he will be switching replacing Sen. Joseph Lane with Sen. John Bell for his Vice President. \n \n'America is a divided nation. I do not see that unity and the rights of all Americans to have property should be mutually exclusive. Let my administration reflect our ability to compromise with our brothers.` Beckenridge said in a speech, just weeks before his innaguration. \n \nBut tensions are still on the rise. Northerners see Bell as too soft on the issue of slavery while Southerners wonder why they should compromise when they won they election."

 acw_beckenridge.10.d:0 "The Abolitionist fervor that had chased Beckenridge has reached a turning point in New England today, after news from Washington of John Bell's intentions to past legislation to persecute many well-known radical Abolitionists including congressman John C. Fremont in hopes of gaining the trusts of the South. \n \n'There are dangers to the legal persecution of political rivals,' Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin stated in a briefing. It has been made clear that a government in Washington, no matter which party, could be trusted to instill the Rights of Men. A second revolution must occur.` \n \nThe Abolitionist rebels have been able to establish a foothold in New England and it will only be a matter of time before the rebellion becomes out of our control, lest we address it immediately."

 acw_beckenridge_news.1.d:0 "President-Elect John C. Beckenridge fled the capital this morning as city-wide demonstrations against his innaguration turned violent. There were reports of gunshots as the former Vice President stood to be sworn in, and a large mob of Abolitionists, some holding torches, stormed into the capital building. While there are no reported deaths, dozens were injured, and many southern congressman have fled Washington in fear for their safety.\n \nThe Abolitionists demand that former Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln be installed as president, but their demands were met to deaf ears. 'This is not Democracy,' Abraham told the crowd. 'You must work with Bell and Beckenridge!' \n \n Since the incident, Beckenridge and many southern congressman have yet to return from South Carolina, where they took refuge, fearing their safety and many, in the south are now calling for seccession from a union that hadn't done much to stop the coup.\n \nIf the Beckenridge does not return to Washington soon, then the States may no longer be able to stay united."
