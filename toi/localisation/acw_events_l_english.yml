 acw_generic.1.d:0 "The day has come for every American to leave their homes and head to the polls to vote for who will become President. \n \nThe campaigning was tough, with the issue of Slavery being the primary issue. The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The incumbent party, the Democrats, have nominated two different candidates. The Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution to the Slavery Issue and therefore will likely not receive many votes. The Southern Democrats call for John Breckinridge as the Democratic nominee, who is the current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. Finally, John Bell, an infleuntial politician and former Senator, has taken an entirely neutral stance on the slavery issue and has established a new political party dubbed the Constitutional Union Party, in favor of unifying the divided North and South however possible. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If neither North nor South gets their favored candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is...\n \n §RDue to a current active rehaul of events & mechanics for the candidates, some candidates are currently disabled until properly reimplemented§!."

 # Norton
 acw_norton.1.t:0 "Emperor of the United States?"
 acw_norton.1.d:0 "Suprising news has come today, with reports of a man named Joshua Norton declaring himself 'Emperor of these United States' and even 'the Protector of Mexico'. Afterwards in the same paragraph of this declaration, he decreed that the United States Congress be assembled in Musical Hall of San Francisco, the city he lives in. It appears as though the populace of the city had gone along with him in a joking mindset, but of which is slowly beginning to morph into serious devotion. \n \nHe holds no close ties to the Military, so we can easily choose to ignore him. However, such a bold move by one man that is beginning to be taken seriously by the people of his hometown is beginning to represent the forgotten legitimacy of the Federal Government during this time of crisis."
 acw_norton.1.a:0 "What a lunatic."
 acw_norton.1.b:0 "Garrison the city, keep an eye on him."
 acw_norton.2.t:0 "Mutiny in California?"
 acw_norton.2.d:0 "Our officers have begun to worry. The Californian National Guard, which we stationed to garrison San Francisco to intimidate Norton, is suspectible to being swayed by his words. They have begun to request for more powers in Court Martialing in order to combat this possible mutiny. But still, it is only suspected, and we aren't sure if it is true or not."
 acw_norton.2.a:0 "It's fine"
 acw_norton.2.b:0 "Empower Court Martialing!"
 acw_norton.3.t:0 "Mutiny in California!"
 acw_norton.3.d:0 "The suspicions were correct! The Californian National Guard has begun to refuse orders from our officers, and has begun to take orders from Norton! Now that Norton has an armed force, he could pose a serious threat against us in the future unless we do something."
 acw_norton.3.a:0 "Let's not get violent"
 acw_norton.3.b:0 "Send in the army!"
 acw_norton.4.t:0 "Californian Mutiny Crushed"
 acw_norton.4.d:0 "With the extra powers granted to the officers, we were successfully able to court martial the National Guard and were able to discover dozens of potential mutineers. With the strict punishment put on these men, the rest of the Guard would not dare to defy the orders of their superiors now. We were successful in averting a potential mutiny."
 acw_norton.4.d_mutiny:0 "As our soldiers arrived at the outskirts of San Francisco, the mutineer National Guard set up barricades to defend the city. San Francisco was then placed under siege for months, and was only averted from getting out of hand by Norton himself. He offered to be placed under arrest so long as the mutineers were allowed to go free, and for the city to receive goods and food again."
 acw_norton.4.a:0 "Good to hear!"
 acw_norton.5.t:0 "Norton Grows in Influence"
 acw_norton.5.d:0 "As we have not sent forces to counteract the mutiny, our officers and loyal National Guardsmen were forced to leave San Francisco. Such a move has made Norton grow in fame across the entirety of California, and this has become worrying as we approach a very controversial election. So long as something catastrophic doesn't happen, however, we should be able to soon retake control of the situation."
 acw_norton.5.a:0 "Worrying"
