 acw_generic.1.d:0 "The day has come for every American to leave their homes and head to the polls to vote for who will become President. \n \nThe campaigning was tough, with the issue of Slavery being the primary issue. The Republican Party's nominee is Abraham Lincoln, a charismatic figure that opposes expansion of Slavery. The incumbent party, the Democrats, have nominated two different candidates. The Northern Democrats favor Stephen A Douglas, who favors a moderate solution to the Slavery Issue and therefore will likely not receive many votes. The Southern Democrats call for John Breckinridge as the Democratic nominee, who is the current Vice President under Buchanan, who promises to ensure the institution of slavery in the west. Finally, John Bell, an infleuntial politician and former Senator, has taken an entirely neutral stance on the slavery issue and has established a new political party dubbed the Constitutional Union Party, in favor of unifying the divided North and South however possible. \n \nThis may be the tipping point that decides on the issue of slavery. If neither North nor South gets their favored candidate, they may rebel against the current system. But for now, the new President of the United States is..."

With insurmountable tensions in sight, President-Elect Beckenridge has formally announced that he will be switching replacing Sen. Joseph Lane with Sen. John Bell for his Vice President. \n \n'America is a divided nation. I do not see that unity and the rights of all Americans to have property should be mutually exclusive. Let my administration reflect our ability to compromise with our brothers.` Beckenridge said in a speech, just weeks before his innaguration. \n \nBut tensions are still on the rise.

Fremont in hopes of gaining the trusts of the South. \n \n'There are dangers to the legal persecution of political rivals,' Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin stated in a briefing. It has been made clear that a government in Washington, no matter which party, could be trusted to instill the Rights of Men.

While there are no reported deaths, dozens were injured, and many southern congressman have fled Washington in fear for their safety.\n \nThe Abolitionists demand that former Illinois Representative Abraham Lincoln be installed as president, but their demands were met to deaf ears. 'This is not Democracy,' Abraham told the crowd. 'You must work with Bell and Beckenridge!' \n \n Since the incident, Beckenridge and many southern congressman have yet to return from South Carolina, where they took refuge, fearing their safety and many, in the south are now calling for seccession from a union that hadn't done much to stop the coup.\n \nIf the Beckenridge does not return to Washington soon, then the States may no longer be able to stay united."

 # CSA Secession
 csa_secession.1.t:0 "Southerners Secede!"
 csa_secession.1.d_lincoln:0 "The results of the 1860 President Election sparked much controversy, as President-Elect Abraham Lincoln became the first to not win with a  majority, but simply the plurality of the vote. Although Lincoln's official stance on slavery was merely to limit it, many in the south are increasingly becoming fearful that a Republican take over of the White House could lead to the abolishment of Slavery. Because of this many states, no longer seeing much obvious benefit in staying within the union are considering secession!"
 csa_secession.1.d_douglas:0 "The results of the 1860 President Election sparked much controversy, as President-Elect Stephen Douglas became the first to not win with a majority, but simply the plurality of the vote. Although there were some hopes that Stephen's northern roots coupled with his southern sympathy would unify the nation, Douglas' last few months in office had amounted to little, if not the opposite.\n \nNow, with President Douglas dead, his administration in tatters, many across the states are wondering if it best to end their tenure with the union."
 csa_secession.1.d_bell:0 "The results of the 1860 President Election sparked much controversy, as President-Elect Johnathan Bell became the first to not win with a majority, but simply the plurality of the vote. Although Bell had ridden to the White House with the policy of unity over division, the Bell Administration has brought anything but.\n \nWith Bell's excessive use of Executive Orders to pass unpopular legislation, there is now an increasing sense of resentment and unrest toward the federal government, especially in the South, who increasingly see their right to own slaves are under attack. Already the South Carolinan state legislation has renounced its loyalty to Washington. We could expect other slave states to follow suit!"
 csa_secession.1.d_bell:0 "After weeks of faliure to address the increasing divide in Washington with the aftermath of the Innaguration Day Coup, tensions between Radical Republicans of New England and the remaining Southern Democrats still in Washington have continued to rise. John Bell has been working closely with Stephen Douglas, another advocate for national unity, to divise a way to bring back Beckenridge to Washington, though many speculate it to be late.\n\nAlready, Beckenridge, along with many of his supporters from the Buchanan Adminstration and Congress have left Washington, and formed a counter-government in Charleston. We could expect other slave states to follow suit!"
