 AUS_Franz_den_Kaiser:0 "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser"
 AUS_Franz_den_Kaiser_desc:0 "Franz Josef has ruled the Austrian Empire since 1848 when he succeeded his uncle Ferdinand to the Austrian throne. Since then he is ruling through Vienna and is seen as the symbol of the might and unity of the Empire."
 AUS_kaiser_franz:0 "Kaiser Franz Josef"
 AUS_Italian_Question:0 "The Italian Question"
 AUS_Italian_Question_desc:0 "Ever since Napoleon invaded Italy there has been a major movement to unite the disparate states of Italy, which would threaten our control over Lombardy-Venetia. The hotbed of this movement is the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont which already in 1849 tried to take over Lombardy but failed miserably. It is however very likely that another conflict should break out, and we must prepare for it."
 AUS_Reinforce_Lombardy:0 "Reinforce Lombardy"
 AUS_Reinforce_Lombardy_desc:0 "Lombardy has been since the Middle Ages one of the most important prosperous regions of Italy and has also been a very rebellious one as was painfully experienced by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Legano in 1176. It is thus imperative that we send money and personel to reinforce Lombardy and Milan to prevent the Italians from having any 'revolutionary' ideas."
 AUS_Viceroy_Maximilian:0 "Appoint Maximilian as Viceroy"
 AUS_Viceroy_Maximilian_desc:0 "Archduke Maximilian is the Emperor's brother and a very competent naval leader making him an excellent candidate to replace Marshall Radetzky, who albeit having served the Empire faithfully has grown very old, as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venice. There is however some opposition due to the Archduke's alleged 'liberal' ideas and that this might encourage the Italians."
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist:0 "Klerikalabsolutist"
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist_desc:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach has instituted a formidable system known as 'Klerikalabsolutism' where the Emperor and the Church have the leading role in administrating the state and ensuring the welfare of the subjects. There is however the ever persistent opposition of the liberals who attack von Bach's system as a very oppressive one and no better than Metternich's administration."
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist1:0 "Klerikalabsolutist"
 AUS_Censor_Liberals:0 "Censor the Liberals"
 AUS_Censor_Liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals have grown to be quite a nuisance to the activities of Baron von Bach and their spreading of constitutional ideas would only endanger His Majesty's rule and the unity of the Empire."
 AUS_Abolish_Internal_Customs:0 "Abolish Internal Custom Duties"
 AUS_Abolish_Internal_Customs_desc:0 "It was decided in 1855 that all internal customs should be abolished between the Austrian Empire and the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen in order to facilitate trade and cooperation. Now the time has come to put this into effect."
 AUS_Abolish_Serfdom:0 "Abolish Serfdom"

 AUS_Subdue_Czechs:0 "Subdue the Czechs"
 AUS_Subdue_Czechs_desc:0 "The inhabitants of Bohemia-Moravia, known as the 'Czechs' have allied themselves with the German liberals and are a constant thorn in our side and aim to prevent the policies of Baron von Bach and his colleagues."
 AUS_Crack_Down_Hungarians:0 "Crack down on the Magyars"
 AUS_Crack_Down_Hungarians_desc:0 "The Magyars have remained extremelly disobedient since their crushing defeat in the revolution of 1848 and have systematically refused to participate in civil governance and to pay taxes. They are surely very bad subjects of His Majesty and it is very urgent that any revolutionary ideas that they carry should be stopped."
 AUS_Disaster_Italy:0 "Disaster in Italy"
 AUS_Disaster_Italy_desc:0 "The unexpected has happened! His Majesty's armies have been defeated in Lombardy, and it seems that even His Majesty intervened the tide could not be turned. The Italians could not have done this were it not for the French. Now that the defeat army is returning home many are already talking about a financial crisis and a political crisis and as in 1848 it is important to act quickly to avoid a disaster."

 AUS_lost_italy1:0 "Disaster in Italy"
 AUS_Victory_Italy:0 "Triumph in Italy"
 AUS_Victory_Italy_desc:0 "As expected our armies commanded by His Majesty have defeated the Italians and their allies and brough glory to the Empire. Piedmont has been defeated again, and this time it seems permanently. All nationalities of the Empire can agree that this victory proves the fortitude of the Empire."
 AUS_win_italy:0 "Triumph in Italy"
 AUS_Future_Italy:0 "The Future of Habsburg Italy"

 AUS_Need_Reform:0 "Need for Reforms"
 AUS_Need_Reform_desc:0 "The time of absolutism seems to have come to a close. Europe has grown much more liberal than in Metternich's time. His Majesty deems it necessary that the government is to start taking into account the will of the people in the political process, though that is to be naturally very liberal."
 AUS_Reichsrat_Advice:0 "Ask the Reichsrat for Advice"
 AUS_Reichsrat_Advice_desc:0 "The first step to making the Empire more constitutional is to ask the advice of the Reichsrat which until presently has served as an advisory body to His Majesty with no real political power. Should the reforms pass we could see a Reichsrat acting as a legislative body as is the case with the other German states."
 AUS_October_Diploma:0 "The October Diploma"

 AUSdiplo.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia has been ours since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat. The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."

The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by the Habsburgs while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support to them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals on the other hand propose that we create a loose confederation named the "Italian League" to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs have only good plans for Italy."

For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Now that Piedmont is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with Napoleonic France, which might entice them to help us in our struggle with Prussa, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."
 AUSdiplo.3.a:0 "We need all the friends we can get"
 AUSdiplo.3.b:0 "It is too risky"
 AUSdiplo.4.t:0 "Austria cedes Savoy and Nice"
 AUSdiplo.4.d:0 "On [GetDateText] our troops entered Savoie and Nice for the first time since 1815, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese. The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from Austria to France. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Interior Minister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement the Austrians showed that not only they can be trusted, but in fact they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and the Habsburgs has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing the politicians to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."

For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. With Austria defeating Piedmont and then imposing a puppet state over it, they decided to cede Savoy and Nice to Napoleonic France. While this is a minor event on its own, it might suggest a rapprochement between Austria and Franch who after all share the same ideological values and are both hostile against Prussia. Should such an alliance be formed, it would be very dangerous for the stability of Europe."

It is wise that he is to be recalled back to Wien, and instead let the Emperor take direct control of the situation to avoid demoralizing entirely the Austrian army. Should Ferenc Gyulay remain as Feldmarschall, this will surely anger the people and the army."

In 1859 he lead the Austrian army once again against the Piedmontese, but this time without the support of Radetzky, and on 1860 was promoted officialy to Feldmarschall."

He later came to distinguish himself during the Battles of Santa Lucia, Vicenza, and Custoza during the First Italian Independence War, and was promoted to Feldmarschall Leutenant in recognition of his victories. He went on to fight in a campaign against the rebellious Hungarians, scoring a major victory at the Battle of Segesvár. Recently, his failures against the Italians and, most especially, the Prussians at Jičín, had resulted in a court martial, however he was able to get acquitted due to his position within Austrian society."

 AUShungaryrevolt.1.d:0 "A very important report has arrived from the Minister of Interior [AUS.GetLeader] describing a resurgence of Magyar nationalism due to our aggressive policies and actions in the past years. The Secret Police has tracked down several 'Pro-Independence Commitees' operating throughout Hungary and many more are believed to exist. These commitees have been collecting funds from abroad to fund a planned revolt. In addition to that, the people too appear dissatisfied with our administration and a large part of the Magyars have refused to pay taxes. The general consensus is that an uprising appears to be planned in Hungary."

The Hungarian revolt has been dubbed 'the Second Hungarian Revolution' and should we not crush the revolt as quickly as possible, it is very much possible that the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen will be lost from the Habsburg domains, and that the Magyars will inspire other nationalities within our empire such as Slavs or Romanians to revolt as well."

The Emperor was coronated by the newly appointed Prime Minister of Hungary, [GetAUHungarianPMName], a former political opponent. The coronation of Franz Joseph marks the beginning of a new era in Austrian politics as the Empire and the Hungarians have reached an agreement known as the 'Compromise' where Hungary will become in effect an independent nation save in terms of defence and foreign policy. Whilst the agreement has been met with skepticism by many Conservatives and outright opposition by many minorities within Hungary which feel that the agreement is in effect a give-in to Hungarian nationalism, the Emperor and the Austrian Minister-President, [GetAUHAustrianMPName], have considered that this is the best way to stabilise Austria which has suffered from a string of military defeats and economic stagnation since the loss in the Austro-Italian war."

 AUSitalypolitics.1.d:0 "With our capture of the Sardinian capital of Turin we have effectively won the war. The Sardinian King and their government have capitulated and a conference will be organised shortly to decide on the future of Sardinia-Piedmont. We are now presented with two options: signing a white peace with Sardinia-Piedmont and respecting the status quo or dividing the Kingdom of Sardinia into two halves with the mainland (Savoy) becoming a client state and the House of Savoy being exiled to Sardinia.\nThe first option will aleviate the fears of the other Great Powers of Europe in our upsetting of the balance of powers and it will also convince many Italians that our plans for Italy are not necessarily evil, but on the other hand it poses the risk that Sardinia-Piedmont once again tries to capture Milan and attempt to form 'Italy'.\nShould we divide the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont into two we will gain control of Piedmont, an important industrial region as well as effectively destroy any nationalist movements within it, we will however suffer the price of infamy and the Italian people will become very unruly."
 AUSitalypolitics.1.a:0 "Divide Sardinia and Piedmont"

 AUSitalypolitics.2.t:0 "The Future of Piedmont"
 AUSitalypolitics.2.d:0 "Austrian troops have secured the mainland posession of the Kingdom of Sardinia, the region of Piedmont, and as per our agreement with Sardinia it will become a client state. The new state will be named the 'Kingdom of Savoy' and will be ruled by a dynasty loyal to us but also relatable to the Italian people. Two options are presented to us for the regnal position: Louis Lucien Bonaparte and Carlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma.\nLouis Lucien Bonaparte is a scion of the Bonaparte familly, the third son of Napoleon Bonaparte's second brother. He is a rather uninspiring man but he can be easily manipulated by Austria and speaks fluently Italian. In addition to that his crowning will certainly improve our relationship with [FRA.GetNameDEF].\nCarlo Ludovico di Bourbon Parma, also known as Charles II of Parma, is the former Duke of Parma who had to abdicate in favour of his son in 1849 due to the pressure from the liberals in the Duchy. Ever since then he has been wandering Europe but he would certainly not disaprove of assuming a title much more significant than his former one. Carlo is however more of a liberal and even though he may assuage the Italians he may not always follow our course of action."

The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."

The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by the Habsburgs while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support to them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals on the other hand propose that we create a loose confederation named the "Italian League" to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs have only good plans for Italy."

Now that Piedmont is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with Napoleonic France, which might entice them to help us in our struggle with Prussa, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."

The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from [AUS.GetNameDEF] to [FRA.GetNameDEF]. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Interior Minister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement the Austrians showed that not only they can be trusted, but in fact they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and the Habsburgs has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing the politicians to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."

With Austria defeating Piedmont and then imposing a puppet state over it, they decided to cede Savoy and Nice to Napoleonic France. While this is a minor event on its own, it might suggest a rapprochement between Austria and Franch who after all share the same ideological values and are both hostile against Prussia. Should such an alliance be formed, it would be very dangerous for the stability of Europe."

 # Austrian Leader Descriptions #
 ################################
 
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_BACH_DESC:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach serves as the Interior Minister of the Habsburg Monarchy and is the de facto leader of Austria in the matters of internal politics. The Baron comes from a family with a long history in the matter of law, and he himself is a Doctor of Laws and a loyal servant of the Empire. Ever since he took power, in 1849 during the Revolution, he has sought to depart from Metternich's overcontrolling system but at the same time has kept much of Metternich's principles in practice in his Klerikalabsolutist form of governance. The Baron favours centralising the Empire, with Vienna as the center of everything, and to maintain loyalty to the Emperor through a rigorous use of the secret police. The Baron is also, like most Conservative members of the Government, a supporter of the Catholic Church within Austria. Even though he enjoys he the support of the Emperor and of most German-Austrians, the Baron's policies have deeply dissatisfied the other ethnic groups in the Empire, and perhaps in due time it will be revealed his policies might have done more harm than good when it comes to the loyalty of Franz Joseph's subjects..."
 ANTON_VON_SCHMERLING_DESC:0 "Anton Ritter von Schmerling is the first Liberal Interior Minister of the Austrian Empire since the Congress of Vienna. Born in Vienna he studied law and for over twenty years served as a public servant in Lower Austria. He rose to prominence during the Revolutions of 1848 when he became President of the Confederate Diet. He supported the Government of Archduke John and quelled the revolt that broke out in Frankfurt.He returned to Vienna with the collapse of the Revolutions and became Minister of Justice until his resignation in 1851. Anton von Schmerling is a Liberal and a Centralist: he belives Austria should become a fully unitary state with a parliamentary government. While his ideas are seen with suspicion from the nobility and the Conservatives, he is seen as a man who might be able to unite the different ethnic groups under German power. The Emperor has put a lot of trust in him, and it remains to be seen what von Schmerling can accomplish."
 AGENOR_GOLUCHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Count Agenor Romuald Gołuchowski was appointed to replace Baron Alexander von Bach as Interior Minister. He is a Conservative and an aristocrat from Galicia and a close advisor to the Emperor, furthermore he has had a successful tenure as Governor of Galicia where he did several projects benefitting the poor region. The Count will oversee the creation of a Constitution liberal enough to satisfy the populace. Nonetheless, he might not be charismatic enough to reconcile all the different ethnic groups within the Empire..."
 ARCHDUKE_RAINIER_DESC:0 "Archduke Rainier Ferdinand of Austria is one of the several senior members of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Archduke studied law in Vienna and as most male members of the Monarchy he joined the Imperial Army. He married his cousine Archduchess Marie Karoline of Austria in 1852, which was to prove a very happy marriage. The Archduke was only mildly interested in politics, but he was seen as a perfect person to continue absolutism in the Empire by the court and so was appointed as Interior Minister by Franz Joseph. The Archduke is perhaps what the Empire needs, a pragmatic leader, though like the Emperor, perhaps slightly inert. Most of the actual power falls within the Absolutist faction within the court, and it is their job to ensure all men and women in the Empire are loyal subjects to His Majesty."
 RICHARD_VON_BELCREDI_DESC:0 "Count Richard von Belcredi was appointed to replace Anton von Schmerling as the Interior Minister. The Count stems from Margraviate of Moravia, though his familly descends from Lombardy, and studied law in Prague and then Vienna. Already a member of the Landtag since 1861, he is a seasoned bureaucrat and an opponent to the so called 'Compromise' with the Hungarians. The Count instead supports that the Empire becomes federalised, though in a conservative way where the local nobles retain essentially all power, in order to combat the various separatist movements. It is ultimately up to the Emperor whether Count von Belcredi will stay for long as Interior Minister, or he will be replaced with a more accomodating politician, as Anton von Schmerling was."
 FRIEDRICH_FERDINAND_VON_BEUST_DESC:0 "Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust is an odd choice for Minister-President, he is both a Saxon and a Protestant. Despite this, he is a clear opponent of Prussia, which so gravely offended us, as well as a very competent statesman. It is hope the Count will bring to an end the negotiations with the Magyars and restore faith to the Monarchy. It is time that misfortune ends and a new period of peace and stability is ushered..."
