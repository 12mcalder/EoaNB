Finally, after such a difficult debate, this act is passed enabling the government of this here Empire to quash and expel vice from here shores with regards to literature of every genre, from science to fantasy. [what follows is a separate line/paragraph] Ultimately, the wishful thinking that pushed this act into action would lead to yet another case of government corruption. While the publication of vice was severely prohibited, London used this power to prohibit scientific and non-scientific literature speaking on topics that it deemed conflicted with their oh so holy reign."
