 HAM_negotiate_with_african_kingdoms_event.1.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] would like to establish a Woermann Traiding Company branch in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. The negotiation would have [FROM.GetName] pay a tribute to [ROOT.GetLeader] as payment for them to operate and have military access within our kingdom.
