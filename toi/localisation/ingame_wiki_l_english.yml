 #Political Stability
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_0:0 "§YPolitical Stability§! is a key mechanic in §YEnd of a New Beginning§! which shows how §Gstable§! the current government of a country is.\n\nPolitical Stability reaches from §R-5§! to §G+3§!. With each level gained or lost, a country either receives §Rdebuffs§! or §Gbonuses§! in certain areas. The default value of §Y0§! has no effects at all. In order to see what effects your current Political Stability has on you, hover over the £pol_stab_1 icon in the topbar. Every time Political Stability rises or sinks, the player receives events informing them about it.\n\nPolitical Stability §Rsinks§! with every politically questionable, aggressive or generally unstable action, like declaring war, losing a war, leaving a faction, losing a border war, ending a civil war and other. If the Political Stability reaches §R-3§! a radical ideology within the country will start gaining traction. If the Political Stability continues to sink and reaches §R-5§! the country will either experience a civil war or political takeover.\n\n§MEvery year§! the player will receive an event talking about an upcoming speech, to be held by the leader of the player's country. These events almost always have multiple options attached to them, which in turn can either lower or increase the current Political Stability. Which option to choose depends on what §Mideology§! the player's government has.\n\nThe options attached to the yearly event can always be categorized into either being §Raggressive§!, §Gcareful§! or §gneutral§!.\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Raggressive§!:\n - Traditional Conservatism\n - Vanguard Communism\n - Anarchism\n - Autocracy\n - Chauvinist Populism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Gcareful§!:\n - Centrism\n - Fundamentalism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §gneutral§!:\n - Social Egalitarian\n - Collectivist Socialism\n - Radical Democracy\n\nApart from the yearly event, Political Stability is increased by various §YFocus Trees§!, §Yevents§! etc."

 #Colonisation
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_2:0 "The §YColonisation§! mechanic is what §YGreat§! and §YSecondary Powers§! use to colonise africa during the §YScramble for Africa§!.\n\nThere are three phases.\n\n§gScramble for Africa§!:\nEach state has a colonisation level, in order to begin colonisation in a state you need to invest £colonial_power (§YColonial Power§!). The cost is either 80£colonial_power for a unclaimed state or 40£colonial_power for a claimed(or cored) state. Each level of colonisation then requires spending both §YLegislative Power§!£pol_power  and §YCommand Power§!£command_power . State Colonisation progress through levels and once you have reached lv4 in a uncontested state you gain control over it and are refunded £colonial_power .\nA contested state is a colonial state that is either occupied by a historical resisitor, or another colonial power is at least 2 colonisation levels behind you. In order to colonise a contested state you need to complete the final colonisation level before any other colonial power can, if another colonial power is at lv6 when a state is colonised in this way they get the option to contest the state causing a colonial crisis.\n\nThe §gColonial Conference§!:\n A §YColonial Conference§! will begin either after a colonial crisis happens or if the date is after 1883 and §YGermany§!, §YPortugal§! and §YBritian§! exist. \nThis conference (historically called the "Berlin" Conference) wil invite all §YGreat§! and §YSecondary powers§! in the world to attend, once the attendants arrive a series of votes will start.\nThe first vote will be on the subject of slavery in africa, the proceding votes will continue in rounds over each colonial region in africa.\nIn your §YDecisions menu§! you will get a selection of colonial powers to pick from in order to chose the controller of the currently selected colonial region, each state owned by a country or that countries puppets within the colonial region will grant a extra vote.\nOnce every Attendant has voted the winner will receive Cores on that colonial region.\nAfter the controller of each §YColonial Region§! in africa has been decided on, the host of the conference will recive prestige and §YColonial Charters§! will be unlocked.\n\n§gColonial Charters§!:\n§YColonial Charters§! are desisions that allow you to completly annex the region you have been assigned in the §YColonial Conference§!, this will take some time and once completed will grant you control of all tribal countries(except resistor capitals)within that region, you then will be declared war on by any tribal resisitors within that region.\n\n§YColonial Power§!£colonial_power is based on the amount of factories you have multipled by 8, plus any colonial tech you have."
