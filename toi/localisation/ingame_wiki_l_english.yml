 #Political Stability
 INGAME_WIKI_TEXT_INDEX_0:0 "§YPolitical Stability§! is a key mechanic in §YEnd of a New Beginning§! which shows how §Gstable§! the current government of a country is.\n\nPolitical Stability reaches from §R-5§! to §G+3§!. With each level gained or lost, a country either receives §Rdebuffs§! or §Gbonuses§! in certain areas. The default value of §Y0§! has no effects at all. In order to see what effects your current Political Stability has on you, hover over the £pol_stab_1 icon in the topbar. Every time Political Stability rises or sinks, the player receives events informing them about it.\n\nPolitical Stability §Rsinks§! with every politically questionable, aggressive or generally unstable action, like declaring war, losing a war, leaving a faction, losing a border war, ending a civil war and other. If the Political Stability reaches §R-3§! a radical ideology within the country will start gaining traction. If the Political Stability continues to sink and reaches §R-5§! the country will either experience a civil war or political takeover.\n\n§MEvery year§! the player will receive an event talking about an upcoming speech, to be held by the leader of the player's country. These events almost always have multiple options attached to them, which in turn can either lower or increase the current Political Stability. Which option to choose depends on what §Mideology§! the player's government has.\n\nThe options attached to the yearly event can always be categorized into either being §Raggressive§!, §Gcareful§! or §gneutral§!.\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Raggressive§!:\n - Traditional Conservatism\n - Vanguard Communism\n - Anarchism\n - Autocracy\n - Chauvinist Populism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §Gcareful§!:\n - Centrism\n - Fundamentalism\n\nIdeologies considered to be §gneutral§!:\n - Social Egalitarian\n - Collectivist Socialism\n - Radical Democracy\n\nApart from the yearly event, Political Stability is increased by various §YFocus Trees§!, §Yevents§! etc."
