 ireland.1.d:0 "Our new Republic has been faced with problems and strife before, but the Unionist Tensions have flared up. Several armed groups have demanded that our government recognise their struggle and their politcal movement as a legitmate.\n\nWe are faced with a tought decision; some hot-headed Republicans believe this is enough motive to round up all the Unionists once and for all, while some are surprisingly in favour of giving them full recognition and even autonomy!\n\nWe can either give them everything they want, and benefit from their wealth, or destroy them, ravaging our country in war once again. Or maybe we can take the long route, and come to a common agreement between us all?\n"

If we strike back with force, we will be on the brink of civil war. We can always ask our friends in Britain for help, but that will give the Republicans even more support. We must decide what to do, or face the chaos of war."
