 OTO_Succession.1.t:0 "Death of [Root.GetLeader]"
 OTO_Succession.1.d:0 "Today,  25 June 1861, our beloved Sultan [Root.GetLeader] died of tubercculosis. Despite his short life of only 38 years he will be remembered forever for his achievements. Most notably among them are the Tanzimat reforms. It remains to be seen if his half-brother Sultan Abdülaziz can step out of [Root.GetLeader]'s enormous shodow."

 OTO_battleofgrahovac.3.descOTO:0 "After entering [MNT.GetName], we faced the resistance force at the village of Grahovac. After a couple days of fierce fighting in and around the village, two of their commanders, Đuro Kusovac and Luka Jovović, led a foolish charge against our troops, but were cut down in the process. Unsurprisingly, their death crushed the enemies morale. We pushed the [MNT.GetAdjective] back into the village, before our heavy artillery pounded them to shreds. All that remained were slaughtered. Our army then marched on Cetinje, before installing pro-Ottoman ministers and demanding for Prince Danillo to stop his ill-fated schemes."
 OTO_battleofgrahovac.3.descMNT:0 "After the [OTO.GetAdjective] entered [MNT.GetName], we faced their army at the village of Grahovac. After a couple days of fierce fighting in and around the village, two of our commanders, Đuro Kusovac and Luka Jovović, led a valiant charge against them, but were cut down in the process. Unsurprisingly, their death crushed our troops morale. We were pushed back into Grahovac, before being bombarded by the [OTO.GetName] cannons.

The [OTO.GetAdjective] troops reached Cetinjie, installing pro-Ottoman ministers and threatening Prince Danillo restricting our autonomy heavily."

 OTO_battleofgrahovac.4.descOTO:0 "After entering [MNT.GetName], we faced the resistance force at the village of Grahovac. However, they were able to force us back on multiple occasions. After a couple days of fierce fighting in and around the village, two of their commanders led a suicidal charge against us. Despite the fact that we beat back their ill-fated assault and killed the commanders, this somehow became a rallying point for the [MNT.GetAdjective]. They were able to take our artillery and force us out of the country. The Great Powers have stepped in, and officially decided the [MNT.GetAdjective]-[OTO.GetAdjective] border, de facto recognizing our rightful vassal’s independence. Now, Montenegrins, Serbs, and other Slavic subjects of ours are using the story of the battle as a rallying story against our supposedly “tyrannical” rule."
 OTO_battleofgrahovac.4.descMNT:0 "After the [OTO.GetAdjective] entered [MNT.GetName], we faced their army at the village of Grahovac. We were quite successful at the start, forcing the enemy back on multiple occasions. After a couple of days of fierce fighting in and around the village, two of our commanders led a legendary charge against them. They were slain in the process, but this worked to boost the morale of our troops, as we rallied around the cry “Avenge our Commanders!” We captured their artillery, and forced them out. The Great Powers have stepped in, and officially decided the [MNT.GetAdjective]-[OTO.GetAdjective] border, de facto recognizing our rightful independence.
