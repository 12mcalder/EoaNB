 portugalforeign.1.t:0 "A Portuguese Treaty of Peace, Amity and Trade"
 portugalforeign.1.d:0 "Recent diplomatic envoys sent from other European nations to the far-flung eastern nation of Japan has started murmurs in the capital about sending an envoy of our own...\n\nOther nations in the West have been concluding favourable commercial treaties with the Japanese, and we should make a move to secure similar advantages in the area. The Japanese are likely to accept the treaty conditions, be it under threat of arms or goodwill from our long and tied history together. Shall we send an envoy?"
 portugalforeign.1.a:0 "Let us propose a treaty"
 portugalforeign.1.b:0 "The benefits are too minimal"
 portugalforeign.2.t:0 "A Portuguese envoy arrives"
 portugalforeign.2.d:0 "Portugal, much like many other colonial powers tied with our history, has sent an envoy with the request to conclude a commercial treaty.\n\nThe treaty, called a "Treaty of Peace, Amity and Trade", has contents that are very much similar in intention and implication to that of treaties that we have concluded with other Western powers that have come to our shores. Requesting trading quarters, coaling rights for ships, trading at set export rates and other various elements found within these treaties to further their interests within our seas and lands.\n\nWhile the treaty is balanced in Portuguese favour, and to our loss, it may be prudent to consider the potential consequences of refusal. The West, after all, have long arms that can reach us even across half the world..."
 portugalforeign.2.a:0 "We will accept the treaty"
 portugalforeign.2.b:0 "We will not accept further enroachments!"
 portugalforeign.3.t:0 "The Shogun accepts our treaty!"
 portugalforeign.3.d:0 "After quite some time now, the envoy that we sent months prior has finally returned. The envoy brings good news, returning with a letter of acceptance, and the seal of the Shogun to prove it.\n\nWith this, the treaty and all of its stipulations will come into effect after a set time when all preparations have been made by both parties involved."
 portugalforeign.3.a:0 "A good deal!"
 portugalforeign.4.t:0 "The Shogun rejects our treaty!"
 portugalforeign.4.d:0 "The envoy we sent for Japan has recently returned after a long journey from east to west. The envoy stated in no uncertain terms that our suggestion for a commercial treaty with the Shogunate has been rejected, and that negotiations have broken down. With a letter from the Shogun proving his statements, it would seem that the treaty suggestion has met with failure..."
 portugalforeign.4.a:0 "Disappointing!"
 portugalforeign.5.t:0 "The treaty is ratified"
 portugalforeign.5.d:0 "With all preparations made and the ratification time expended for both parties equally, the "Treaty of Peace, Amity and Trade" has been ratified between Portugal and Japan. All treaty obligations and stipulations are now fully in effect between the two, and both can reap the benefits and detriments of its effect on policy..."
 portugalforeign.5.a:0 "An agreement struck is kept!"
