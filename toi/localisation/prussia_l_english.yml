prussiaconscrisis.1.t:0 "Von Roon's Reform Plan"
prussiaconscrisis.1.d:0 "Our country wasn't really affected by Second Italian War of Independence. But broke of this war had shown how quickly a military escalation could occur. Now we are attempting to reform our military forces. Kriegsminister  von Roon is proposing an idea to increase our number of soldiers, specially population of Prussia increased a lot since end of the Napoleonic Wars. What should we do?"
prussiaconscrisis.1.a:0 "Vorwärts!"
prussiaconscrisis.1.b:0 "Is it really necessary?"
prussiaconscrisis.2.t:0 "Reform of Prussian Army"
prussiaconscrisis.2.d:0 "Based on the suggestions proposed by Kriegsminister von Roon, the Army and Landwehr shall be reformed, with the former increasing in size, and the latter being all but abolished"
prussiaconscrisis.3.t:0 "Change of military budget"
prussiaconscrisis.3.d:0 "von Roon's reforms were to help expand the army for the first time since 1815, but that takes money, so an increased budget must be submitted to Parliament."
prussiaconscrisis.4.t:0 "The Parliament denies budget"
prussiaconscrisis.4.d:0 "The Liberals in Parliament have rejected von Roon's reforms. They fear a strengthening of the monarchy and its army will see much of the liberal progress made since the revolutions of 1848. They prefer a strengthening of the Landwehr which is more . . . politically reliable. They will likely use their 'Power of the Purse' to block von Roon at every turn."
prussiaconscrisis.5.t:0 "Liberals gained more power!"
prussiaconscrisis.5.d:0 "In a powerful blow to the Prince-Regent, his supporters, and their conservative agenda, a new Parliament has been elected that is made up of at least two thirds liberals and progressives, who will likely oppose any further Army reforms and other policy proposals made by the Prince-Regent. Forseeing this, the Prince-Regent has dissolved Parliament, creating a constitutional crisis."
prussiaconscrisis.6.t:0 "Bismarck proposed for Prime Minister"
prussiaconscrisis.6.d:0 "So soon after the King's ascension and already it feels to him that the nation is ready to fall apart. Prussia cannot stand if the King and Parliament can't agree on policy. Wilhelm feels the best course of action is to abdicate in favor of his son, and let Parliament have their victory. However the Kriegsminister has suggested Parliament would be much more amenable to his reforms if a new Prime Minister were put in power. He has suggested an unusual candidate, our ambassador to France. This man has in the past strongly supported any action taken by the King, and is a close supporter of von Roon. Perhaps we should give this Bismarck person a chance before doing anything drastic."
prussiaconscrisis.6.a:0 "Bismarck as new PM"
prussiaconscrisis.6.b:0 "Zu Hohenlohe stays"
prussiaconscrisis.7.t:0 "Proporsal to the Parliament"

prussiaconscrisis.8.t:0 "Wilhelm's Abdication"
prussiaconscrisis.8.d:0 "How can one man change the mind of parliament? Prussia has made its opinion clear, and it stands with parliament, not the King. Today Wilhelm I von Hohenzollern, King of Prussia abdicated the throne, leaving it to his son."
prussiaconscrisis.9.t:0 "Time of troubles"
prussiaconscrisis.9.d:0 "The King's abdication has taken much of the nation by surprise and shaken it. Parliament has won this battle, but forcing the King to abdicate has fractured certain parties and thrown others into confusion. The future of this nation is up for grabs!"
prussiaconscrisis.10:0 "Liberals took power"
prussiaconscrisis.10.d:0 "Although shaken by the King's abdication, a liberal coalition has once again taken power in Parliament. They will surely pursue their previous liberal agenda without any interference from an anti-democratic Monarch."
prussiaconscrisis.11:0 "Socialists took power"
prussiaconscrisis.11.d:0 "The progressives, who originally rejected any compromise with the former King's proposed reforms, have risen to head the new ruling coalition. The socialist leanings of this party will surely lead to progressive social policies well regarded by the average Prussian worker."
prussiaconscrisis.7.a:0 "Was zum Teufel?"

PRS_roons_reform_bill:0 "Allerhöchste Kabinetts-Order 05.05.1860"

prussiaconscrisis.12.t:0 "The Ruling Party Question"
prussiaconscrisis.12.d:0 "Among the new Progressive coalition, there are two leading parties: Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiter-Verein (ADAV) or the General German Workers Association is not merely a progressive party but outright socialist that seeks to transform this country via Socialist policies; and Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine (VDAV) or The Association of German Workers' Associations has shown itself to be more moderate with a willingness to compromise, but only in pursuit of its progressive agenda"
prussiaconscrisis.12.a:0 "ADAV shall lead our coalition!"
prussiaconscrisis.12.b:0 "VDAV shall lead our coalition!"

prussiaconscrisis.14.t:0 "Parliamentary negotiations Fail!"
prussiaconscrisis.14.d:0 "The King's abdication has taken much of the nation by surprise and shaken it. Parliament has won this battle, but forcing the King to abdicate has fractured certain parties and thrown others into confusion. The future of this nation is up for grabs!"

prussiaconscrisis.15.t:0 "The Question of the Monarchy"
prussiaconscrisis.15.d:0 "The Liberal coalition was thrown into chaos by the King's abdication. In theory the former King's young son Frederick III now rules. But Parliament has shown how it will not always submit to the whims of Kings. Now we must ask ourselves if Prussia is best served holding on to that ancient tradition that is the monarchy, of if it would be better if Prussia, and Parliament, did away with Kings forever."
prussiaconscrisis.15.a:0 "Parliament has humbled the King, now that he has learnt his place, we can continue on with business."
prussiaconscrisis.15.b:0 "The last King has shown the limitations of a constitutional monarchy, down with the King! Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit!"

PRS_demote_landwehr_desc:0 "Many members of the Landwehr collaborated with the rebels during the March Revolution of 1848/49.

PRS_contest_austria_desc:0 "Despite a rather underdeveloped economy, their internal struggles as a multi-national empire, and their failure in the Sardinian War, the Austrians still claim presidency over all other members of the German Confederation.
