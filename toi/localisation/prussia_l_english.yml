prussia.37.t:0 "Lessons from the Austro-Sardinian War"
prussia.37.d:0 "Both, the Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven the deficiencies of our army quite plainly. We need to think of possible reform measures."
prussia.37.a:0 "An's Werk!"
prussia.38.t:0 "Deutscher Nationalverein"
prussia.38.d:0 "The violent aggravation of the Italian struggle for unification sent shockwaves across the continent. Especially in fragmented Germany, the ideals of the nation-state fell on very fertile ground. One of the main proponents of a united German nation was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Sardinian War - the German National Association or 'Deutscher Nationalverein.' Formed by liberals and moderate democrats, the Association supported a Prussian-led German nation-state without Austria."
prussia.38.a:0 "Von der Maas bis an die Memel, von der Etsch bis an den Belt..."
prussia.39.t:0 "Proclamation of a united Italy"
prussia.39.d:0 "The proclamation of an Italian nation-state greatly influenced the German public. A growing number of people, especially among the bourgeois middle class, wholeheartedly supported the idea of a German national state. If the Italians were able to do it, why shouldn't the Germans, too?"
prussia.39.a:0 "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles..."
prussia.40.t:0 "Preußischer Volksverein"
prussia.40.d:0 "The proclamation of Italy and its subsequent recognition by Prussia once again inspired the German national movement, this time especially among the conservative clientele in the Prussian countryside. The foundation of the antiliberal, conservative Prussian People's Association or 'Preußischer Volksverein' served the purpose of bringing about a Prussian-led united Germany - by force of arms, if need be..."
prussia.40.a:0 "Über alles in der Welt!"
prussia.41.t:0 "Deutscher Reformverein"
prussia.41.d:0 "The increasing political heft of the national movement that supported a Prussian-led Germany without Austria scared a number of people, especially in the Catholic parts of western and southern Germany. Their reaction was the foundation of the Prussian 'Reformverein' that supported a reform of the German Confederation and the integration of Austria. It had little political impact, though."
prussia.41.a:0 "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
prussia.42.t:0 "The New Era Cabinet - Karl Anton von Hohenzollern new PM"
prussia.42.d:0 "With the regency of Crown Prince Wilhelm came an unexpected wave of liberalism in Prussia. The crown prince, who was hitherto seen as a reactionary by many in Prussia, had spent some time at the court of Queen Victoria in liberal Great Britain after being forced to flee from Berlin amidst the March Revolution of 1848/49. The cabinet he installed after acceding regency, headed by PM Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sparked hopes of a liberal wind of change."
prussia.42.a:0 "Wohlan!"
prussia.43.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV)"
prussia.43.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Supporters of the German workers' movement have gathered in Leipzig, Saxony, today to establish Germany's first labor party, the General German Workers' Association or 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV). Headed by a certain Ferdinand Lassalle, the party delegates predominantly support a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.43.a:0 "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht..."
prussia.44.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (VDAV)"
prussia.44.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. As a reaction to the foundation of the ADAV, supporters of a different approach within the German workers' movement have gathered in Frankfurt today to establish another labor party, the Congress of German Workers' Associations or 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine' (VDAV). Leopold Sonnemann, Max Hirsch and Eugen Richter are among the leaders of the new party, who - at the moment - predominantly supports a reformist socialist agenda, although the revolutionary wing is gaining power."
prussia.44.a:0 "...und erkenne deine Macht!"
prussia.45.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP)"
prussia.45.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Following differences primarily concerning the question of German nationalism, the VDAV was split and the majority of its supporters have gathered in Eisenach today to establish a successor labor party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party or 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP). August Bebel and Karl Liebknecht are among the leaders of the new party, who predominantly supports a Marxist socialist agenda."
prussia.45.a:0 "Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!"
prussia.46.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP)"
prussia.46.d:0 "The German unification made the most striking dispute between the different German labor parties obsolote. But the unity had been violently crafted under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy and military, thus, the German workers' movement awoke to the danger of being suppressed by conservative authorities. In order to strengthen their political weight, many of its supporters have gathered in Gotha today to establish a united labor party, the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany or 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP), predominantly supporting a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.46.a:0 "These socialists are becoming more and more dangerous..."
prussia.47.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD)"
prussia.47.d:0 "The Bismarckian Anti-Socialist Laws have proven that the worst fears of the German workers' movement were not unfounded. But Bismarck and the laws are a thing of the past now. The vast majority of the supporters of socialism in Germany have gathered in Erfurt today to establish a newly united labor party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany or 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD), supporting a reformist socialist agenda, at least for now..."
prussia.47.a:0 "We will have to watch them very closely."
prussia.48.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP)"
prussia.48.d:0 "Negotiations for a North German constitution have recently started, but not everyone in Prussia is happy with the developments that will most likely result in a compromise to integrate the other states in northern Germany. The conservatives are estranged over the dispute of preserving a Prussian spirit and progress towards German unity. As a result, the party members that support our plans for unity have separated themselves from the traditional conservatives. We can bank on the support of the Free Conservative Party, or 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP), for our future proposals."
prussia.48.a:0 "Sehr gut!"

prussiaconscrisis.21.d:0 "According to Art. 99 of the Prussian constitution, every year parliament has to pass legislation that clearly states the country's expenses and revenues for the forthcoming year.

prussiaconscrisis.29.t:0 "Danziger Episode"
prussiaconscrisis.29.d:0 "The restriction of press freedom does not have many supporters in Germany, not even all members of the closest royal family agree with it. Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm spoke to the press this morning during his official visit in Danzig.

prussiaconscrisis.29.a:0 "How dare he?!"
prussiaconscrisis.30.t:0 "Foundation of the Nationalliberale Partei (NLP)"
prussiaconscrisis.30.d:0 "The question of indemnity, in this case meaning the subsequent legitimization of a previously enforced political action, has divided the liberal movement. Whereas the DFP delegates predominantly rejected the bill, more right-leaning liberals voted in favor. The latter have now formed a political assembly of their own: the National Liberal Party, or 'Nationalliberale Partei' (NLP). Maybe the chancellor will be able to work together with the liberals at least in part after all."

prussiaforeign.15.t:0 "The Government Decides on the Question of Navy Bonds"
prussiaforeign.15.d:0 "If we want to strenghten our navy presence in the Baltic Sea, we need to expand the fleet. Although we lack the capacity for large scale warships, our domestic industry would surely welcome a contract for smaller warships like gunboats. We could use navy bonds to finance such a commission. Should we issue them?"
prussiaforeign.15.a:0 "Issue the bonds."
prussiaforeign.15.b:0 "Don't issue the bonds. Prussia does not need a navy."
prussiaforeign.16.t:0 "Warships Ordered from Domestic Dockyards Have Arrived"
prussiaforeign.16.d:0 "Let's welcome 15 gunboats of the 'Jäger-Klasse' to our navy."

prussiaforeign.19.a:0 "Weiter so!"
prussiaforeign.20.t:0 "Expansion of Naval Infrastructure Successfully Completed"
prussiaforeign.20.d:0 "We have successfully finished the expansion of our naval infrastructure. These efforts will surely help our navy when the time comes."

prussiaelection.1.d:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1858 have taken place and the final results came in a few minutes ago. The liberal-leaning New Era cabinet has emerged from the election even stronger, and it seems like the liberal ideology is on the rise for now..."

prussiaelection.2.d:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1861 have taken place and the final results came in a few minutes ago. The delegates of the liberal parties have emerged as winners. It seems that the liberal turn in Prussia will continue..."

prussiaelection.4.a:0 "Verdammt!"
prussiaelection.5.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1862 - Minor Liberal Victory"
prussiaelection.5.d:0 "Following the dissolution of parliament, there had to be new elections. Despite hope from the king and significant electoral corruption, the Prussian people have once again expressed their support for liberal ideals, but the conservatives might have been able to cut their losses pretty significantly. Although the government might still have a hard time pushing their policies and legislation through parliament, there is reason to hope."
prussiaelection.5.a:0 "Nun gut."
prussiaelection.6.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1863"
prussiaelection.6.d:0 "Although it bought the conservative government precious time, the 'closure' of parliament left an unpleasent vacuum, even by Bismarckian standards. New elections could not suspended indefinitely, and so the men of Prussia again headed to the polls, five months after parliament had been shut down. Unsurprisingly, the liberal movement emerged victorious once more."
prussiaelection.6.a:0 "Is this the end for Bismarck?"
prussiaelection.7.t:0 "Call an Election for a Constitutive Reichstag"
prussiaelection.7.d:0 "The Austrians are defeated and we have reached an agreement with the north German states to form a union.

prussiaconstitutionngc.1.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Federal or Centralized"
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.d:0 "The most important question should be tackled right at the start: how centralized should the new union be? We will certainly have to federalize the Prussian system to accomodate the acceding states. But should we allow all states equal say and distribute government authorities fairly, or should we rather try to keep as many powers as possible in Prussian hands?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.a:0 "Reasonable centralization."
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.b:0 "Thorough federalism."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Commander-in-Chief"
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.d:0 "Now that it has become clear who will be the head of state, we need to specify the constitutional rights of that position. The delegates' main concern is the role of commander-in-chief. Should the head of state also be our highest ranking officer who exercises supreme command and control over the Confederation's armed forces? Or should the delegates be able to appoint a commander-in-chief in times of war? This would likely create friction both with the Prussian and among the general staff, though."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.a:0 "The head of state will be commander-in-chief."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.b:0 "A selected person will be commander-in-chief."
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Ministries"
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.d:0 "It is certain that the chancellery will be quite powerful. Should we set up proper ministries to both aid and restrict the powers of said office or will the chancellor be the lone minister who can pull all the strings?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.a:0 "A powerful chancellery needs no ministries."
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.b:0 "We should set up a number of ministries."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Accumulation of Offices"
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.d:0 "As it is certain that the chancellor will occupy a key role in our government, one way or another, the question of the Prussian prime minister arises. Should both offices, chancellery of the confederation and Prussian premiership, be allowed to be held by the same person? This would certainly give the chancellery even more power, especially in the states' parliamentary chamber."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.a:0 "The chancellor should also be Prussian prime minister."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.b:0 "The chancellor must not be Prussian prime minister."
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Voting Rights"
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.d:0 "Another primary concern for delegates is the electoral franchise that will decide the composition of the Reichstag. The Bundesrath delegates will be elected based on the law of the individual member states, but for the Reichstag we might need to find a different solution. Should we keep the individual state laws or reform the election process for the Reichstag to promote true representation and help legitimize the union in the eyes of the public?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.a:0 "Universal male suffrage is the way forward."
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.b:0 "Keep existing suffrage laws for the Reichstag election as well."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Ministerial Responsibility"
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.d:0 "The delegates of the constitutive Reichstag argue whether it would be wise to implement ministerial responsibility, by which the chancellor would be accountable for the government's actions. Whilst that is certainly a reasonable proposition, we have to decide whether the chancellor will have to answer to parliament or only to the head of state."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.a:0 "The chancellor will answer to the head of state and nobody else."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.b:0 "The chancellor will also have to answer to parliament."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Pay and Perks"
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.d:0 "Some members of the constitutive Reichstag argue that we should offer pay and perks to elected delegates. Whilst this would certainly reimburse them for their efforts, we also risk creating a growing flock of career politicians that will cost the union a significant sum of money. Additionally, potentially undesired subjects, like representatives of the workers' movement, could more easily afford to occupy a seat in parliament..."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.a:0 "There will be no pay and perks for delegates."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.b:0 "It is only fair to pay the delegates."
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Budget and Taxes"
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.d:0 "Since the individual states will basically continue to operate their internal matters independently, the main bulk of expenses for the union will be militarily, plus maybe a small upkeep for the central authorities and delegates, should we decide to pay them. Parliament will control and approve the budget. But how will we finance the additional expenses? Will the income from tariffs at the external borders and a share of the consumption tax suffice, or will we have to implement union taxes?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.a:0 "The income from tariffs and consumption tax is enough."
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.b:0 "We will impose new taxes."
prussiaconstitutionngc.9.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Head of State"
prussiaconstitutionngc.9.d:0 "AI only. Previous situation will decide the head of state."
prussiaconstitutionngc.9.a:0 "King of Prussia"
prussiaconstitutionngc.9.b:0 "Bundespräsident"
prussiaconstitutionngc.10.t:0 "The King of Prussia Will Head the Bundespräsidium"
prussiaconstitutionngc.10.d:0 "The king has led us through the wars, he will be the union's head of state. This will stabilize the union and keep the other monarchs happy, as they will keep their position in their respective dominions."
prussiaconstitutionngc.10.a:0 "Long live the king!"
prussiaconstitutionngc.11.t:0 "A Federal President - the so-called 'Bundespräsident' - Will Head the Union"
prussiaconstitutionngc.11.d:0 "Our republic has proven more efficient and successful than any of our monarchic predecessor states. We will democratically elect a head of state, the 'Bundespräsident', who will hold the highest office in the new union."
prussiaconstitutionngc.11.a:0 "Long live the president!"
prussiaconstitutionngc.12.t:0 "Rising Support for Political Catholicism"
prussiaconstitutionngc.12.d:0 "Although we strive for denominational equality, our Catholic subjects fear future oppression. That's why they are starting to tie their political behavior to their belief."
prussiaconstitutionngc.12.a:0 "We need to watch the Catholics."
prussiaconstitutionngc.13.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Zentrumspartei'"
prussiaconstitutionngc.13.d:0 "So-called political Catholicism is no longer an intellectual subject only. Catholics from around the country have gathered to establish an all-Catholic political party that aims to represent the interests of all Catholics within our borders. Their leader seems to be a certain Ludwig Windthorst from the former Kingdom of Hanover."
prussiaconstitutionngc.13.a:0 "A Guelph and Catholic? We need to watch them even more closely."
prussiaconstitutionngc.14.t:0 "Member States Struggle with the Difficulties of Freedom of Movement"
prussiaconstitutionngc.14.d:0 "Although successfully implemented, the freedom of movement act does cause some problems for all of the confederation's member states. They simply fear losing control over their subjects if they can roam around so freely, plus, the question of identity checks when crossing the external borders still persists. We will need to find a solution."
prussiaconstitutionngc.14.a:0 "An die Arbeit!"
prussiaconstitutionngc.15.t:0 "Unitary Measurements - the need for an Industrial Code"
prussiaconstitutionngc.15.d:0 "After implementing unitary measurements and the metric system across all member states, there still needs to be a comprehensive law regulating the way citizens can conduct their business. This will both protect employees from exploitation and injury as well as enable healthy competition across all business sectors."
prussiaconstitutionngc.15.a:0 "Auf geht's!"

PRS_demote_landwehr:0 "Demote Landwehr"
PRS_demote_landwehr_desc:0 "Many members of the Landwehr collaborated with the rebels during the March Revolution of 1848/49.

PRS_befriend_russia_desc:0 "The Russians have helped us in fighting off Napoléon, the legacy of the Holy Alliance still subsists between our nations.

PRS_austria_no_zollverein:0 "Keep Austria Out of the Zollverein"
PRS_austria_no_zollverein_desc:0 "The Austrians have repeatedly asked for their German-speaking territories to be attached to the Zollverein.
