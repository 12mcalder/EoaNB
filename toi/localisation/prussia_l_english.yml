In 1815, Frederick William III of Prussia decided to allow the small Principality to join the Swiss Confederation while still remaining under our effective control. Yet, in 1848, those ungrateful dogs revolted against our rule! Since then, we have been pressing our claim to the region.

They lack food, medical care, and due to nature of the system they were tricked into, they constatnly fall deeper and deeper into debts. As Avé-Lallemant put it, it is a human butchery.

prussia.38.t:0 "Deutscher Nationalverein"
prussia.38.d:0 "The violent aggravation of the Italian struggle for unification sent shockwaves across the continent. Especially in fragmented Germany, the ideals of the nation-state fell on very fertile ground. One of the main proponents of a united German nation was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Sardinian War - the German National Association or 'Deutscher Nationalverein.' Formed by liberals and moderate democrats, the Association supported a Prussian-led German nation-state without Austria."

prussia.40.t:0 "Preußischer Volksverein"
prussia.40.d:0 "The proclamation of Italy and its subsequent recognition by Prussia once again inspired the German national movement, this time especially among the conservative clientele in the Prussian countryside.

prussia.40.a:0 "Über alles in der Welt!"
prussia.41.t:0 "Deutscher Reformverein"
prussia.41.d:0 "The increasing political heft of the national movement that supported a Prussian-led Germany without Austria scared a number of people, especially in the Catholic parts of western and southern Germany.

prussia.42.t:0 "The New Era Cabinet - Karl Anton von Hohenzollern new PM"
prussia.42.d:0 "With the regency of Crown Prince Wilhelm came an unexpected wave of liberalism in Prussia. The crown prince, who was hitherto seen as a reactionary by many in Prussia, had spent some time at the court of Queen Victoria in liberal Great Britain after being forced to flee from Berlin amidst the March Revolution of 1848/49. The cabinet he installed after acceding regency, headed by PM Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sparked hopes of a liberal wind of change."

prussia.43.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV)"
prussia.43.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Supporters of the German workers' movement have gathered in Leipzig, Saxony, today to establish Germany's first labor party, the General German Workers' Association or 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV). Headed by a certain Ferdinand Lassalle, the party delegates predominantly support a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.43.a:0 "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht..."
prussia.44.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (VDAV)"
prussia.44.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. As a reaction to the foundation of the ADAV, supporters of a different approach within the German workers' movement have gathered in Frankfurt today to establish another labor party, the Congress of German Workers' Associations or 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine' (VDAV). Leopold Sonnemann, Max Hirsch and Eugen Richter are among the leaders of the new party, who - at the moment - predominantly supports a reformist socialist agenda, although the revolutionary wing is gaining power."
prussia.44.a:0 "...und erkenne deine Macht!"
prussia.45.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP)"
prussia.45.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Following differences primarily concerning the question of German nationalism, the VDAV was split and the majority of its supporters have gathered in Eisenach today to establish a successor labor party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party or 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP). August Bebel and Karl Liebknecht are among the leaders of the new party, who predominantly supports a Marxist socialist agenda."
prussia.45.a:0 "Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!"
prussia.46.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP)"
prussia.46.d:0 "The German unification made the most striking dispute between the different German labor parties obsolote. But the unity had been violently crafted under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy and military, thus, the German workers' movement awoke to the danger of being suppressed by conservative authorities. In order to strengthen their political weight, many of its supporters have gathered in Gotha today to establish a united labor party, the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany or 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP), predominantly supporting a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.46.a:0 "These socialists are becoming more and more dangerous..."
prussia.47.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD)"
prussia.47.d:0 "The Bismarckian Anti-Socialist Laws have proven that the worst fears of the German workers' movement were not unfounded. But Bismarck and the laws are a thing of the past now. The vast majority of the supporters of socialism in Germany have gathered in Erfurt today to establish a newly united labor party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany or 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD), supporting a reformist socialist agenda, at least for now..."
prussia.47.a:0 "We will have to watch them very closely."
prussia.48.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP)"
prussia.48.d:0 "Negotiations for a North German constitution have recently started, but not everyone in Prussia is happy with the developments that will most likely result in a compromise to integrate the other states in northern Germany. The conservatives are estranged over the dispute of preserving a Prussian spirit and progress towards German unity. As a result, the party members that support our plans for unity have separated themselves from the traditional conservatives. We can bank on the support of the Free Conservative Party, or 'Freikonservative Partei' (FkP), for our future proposals."
prussia.48.a:0 "Sehr gut!"
prussia.49.t:0 "Rising Support for Political Catholicism - 'Fraktion des Zentrums'"
prussia.49.d:0 "Although we strive for denominational equality, our Catholic subjects fear future oppression. That's why they are starting to tie their political behavior to their belief. Catholic delegates in parliament have taken the first step to the establishment of a political party. They now stand united as the so-called faction of the centre, or 'Fraktion des Zentrums.'"
prussia.49.a:0 "We need to watch the Catholics."
prussia.50.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Zentrumspartei'"
prussia.50.d:0 "So-called political Catholicism is no longer an intellectual subject only. Catholics from around the country have gathered to establish an all-Catholic political party that aims to represent the interests of all Catholics within our borders. Their leader seems to be a certain Ludwig Windthorst from the former Kingdom of Hanover."
prussia.50.a:0 "A Guelph and Catholic? We need to watch them even more closely."

prussiaconscrisis.23.d:0 "One day after the resignation of the New Era cabinet, the king has chosen Adolf Prinz zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen as Prussia's new prime minister. Political power, however, now resides in the hands of the Prussian high command, headed by war minister Albrecht von Roon."
prussiaconscrisis.23.a:0 "Viel Glück!"

prussiaconscrisis.25.d:0 "After an intense discussion with the new candidate, Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, has announced his desire to continue the fight for his desired army reform against parliament and with that has chosen Otto von Bismarck as new prime minister of Prussia."
prussiaconscrisis.25.a:0 "'Prussia's Position in Germany will not be determined by its liberalism but by its power!'"
prussiaconscrisis.26.t:0 "Otto von Bismarck Delivered 'Blood and Iron' Speech to Budget Commission"
prussiaconscrisis.26.d:0 "The new prime minister Otto von Bismarck concluded yesterday's speech with the following statement: 'Not through speeches and majority decisions will the great questions of the day be decided - that was the great mistake of 1848 and 1849 - but by iron and blood.' The delegates are still uncertain about his intentions, but they feel reaffirmed in their prejudices against the alleged conservative agitator Bismarck."
prussiaconscrisis.26.a:0 "Riecht nach Blut..."
prussiaconscrisis.27.t:0 "Another Parliament Dissolution - Bismarck Governs without a Budget"
prussiaconscrisis.27.d:0 "The king seems to be tieing his fate to that of Bismarck. After the majority of delegates reassured the prime minister that they would not change their minds on the pending army reform budget, the king has once again dissolved parliament. Bismarck now governs without a budget, and it will be interesting to see how he justifies this outright breach of the law."
prussiaconscrisis.27.a:0 "Let's see, what does the constitution say?"
prussiaconscrisis.28.t:0 "Alvensleben Convention"
prussiaconscrisis.28.d:0 "Russia is currently dealing with an Uprising in their Polish territories. Prussia, too, has a comparatively large Polish minority population and we could be facing a similar situation some time in the future. We could use this situation to our advantage and come to good terms with the Russians, which may help us in the future. After all, a Polish state right at our border would be a welcome ally to any potential foe."
prussiaconscrisis.28.a:0 "This will strengthen our relationship with Russia."
prussiaconscrisis.28.b:0 "Cancel the proposed convention!"
prussiaconscrisis.29.t:0 "Danziger Episode"
prussiaconscrisis.29.d:0 "The restriction of press freedom does not have many supporters in Germany, not even all members of the closest royal family agree with it. Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm spoke to the press this morning during his official visit in Danzig. Although very cautious, his words did express a sense of criticism against his father, King Wilhelm I. This will certainly have repercussions."
prussiaconscrisis.29.a:0 "How dare he?!"
prussiaconscrisis.30.t:0 "Foundation of the Nationalliberale Partei (NLP)"
prussiaconscrisis.30.d:0 "The question of indemnity, in this case meaning the subsequent legitimization of a previously enforced political action, has divided the liberal movement. Whereas the DFP delegates predominantly rejected the bill, more right-leaning liberals voted in favor. The latter have now formed a political assembly of their own: the National Liberal Party, or 'Nationalliberale Partei' (NLP). Maybe the chancellor will be able to work together with the liberals at least in part after all."

prussiaforeign.2.d:0 "Henry Heuksen, a respected Dutch-American interpretator in Japan, is dead. After dinner with Eulenberg, he was ambushed by a group of Japanese Shishi near the Zenpuku Temple in Edo. Heuksen suffered mortal wounds to both sides of his body in the fight. He mounted a horse and galloped about 200 yards to the American Legation, where he was taken inside and treated, but died of his wounds later that night. This will surely have diplomatic impact..."

prussiaforeign.15.d:0 "If we want to strenghten our navy presence in the Baltic Sea, we need to expand the fleet. Although we lack the capacity for large scale warships, our domestic industry would surely welcome a contract for smaller warships like gunboats. We could use navy bonds to finance such a commission. Should we issue them?"
prussiaforeign.15.a:0 "Issue the bonds."

prussiaelection.5.d:0 "Following the dissolution of parliament, there had to be new elections. Despite hope from the king and significant electoral corruption, the Prussian people have once again expressed their support for liberal ideals, but the conservatives might have been able to cut their losses pretty significantly. Although the government might still have a hard time pushing their policies and legislation through parliament, there is reason to hope."
prussiaelection.5.a:0 "Nun gut."
prussiaelection.6.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1863"
prussiaelection.6.d:0 "Although it bought the conservative government precious time, the 'closure' of parliament left an unpleasent vacuum, even by Bismarckian standards. New elections could not suspended indefinitely, and so the men of Prussia again headed to the polls, five months after parliament had been shut down. Unsurprisingly, the liberal movement emerged victorious once more."

prussiaconstitutionngc.1.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Federal or Centralized"
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.d:0 "The most important question should be tackled right at the start: how centralized should the new union be? We will certainly have to federalize the Prussian system to accomodate the acceding states. But should we allow all states equal say and distribute government authorities fairly, or should we rather try to keep as many powers as possible in Prussian hands?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.a:0 "Reasonable centralization."
prussiaconstitutionngc.1.b:0 "Thorough federalism."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Commander-in-Chief"
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.d:0 "Now that it has become clear who will be the head of state, we need to specify the constitutional rights of that position. The delegates' main concern is the role of commander-in-chief. Should the head of state also be our highest ranking officer who exercises supreme command and control over the Confederation's armed forces? Or should the delegates be able to appoint a commander-in-chief in times of war? This would likely create friction both with the Prussian and among the general staff, though."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.a:0 "The head of state will be commander-in-chief."
prussiaconstitutionngc.2.b:0 "A selected person will be commander-in-chief."
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Ministries"
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.d:0 "It is certain that the chancellery will be quite powerful. Should we set up proper ministries to both aid and restrict the powers of said office or will the chancellor be the lone minister who can pull all the strings?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.a:0 "A powerful chancellery needs no ministries."
prussiaconstitutionngc.3.b:0 "We should set up a number of ministries."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Accumulation of Offices"
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.d:0 "As it is certain that the chancellor will occupy a key role in our government, one way or another, the question of the Prussian prime minister arises. Should both offices, chancellery of the confederation and Prussian premiership, be allowed to be held by the same person? This would certainly give the chancellery even more power, especially in the states' parliamentary chamber."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.a:0 "The chancellor should also be Prussian prime minister."
prussiaconstitutionngc.4.b:0 "The chancellor must not be Prussian prime minister."
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Voting Rights"
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.d:0 "Another primary concern for delegates is the electoral franchise that will decide the composition of the Reichstag. The Bundesrath delegates will be elected based on the law of the individual member states, but for the Reichstag we might need to find a different solution. Should we keep the individual state laws or reform the election process for the Reichstag to promote true representation and help legitimize the union in the eyes of the public?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.a:0 "Universal male suffrage is the way forward."
prussiaconstitutionngc.5.b:0 "Keep existing suffrage laws for the Reichstag election as well."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Ministerial Responsibility"
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.d:0 "The delegates of the constitutive Reichstag argue whether it would be wise to implement ministerial responsibility, by which the chancellor would be accountable for the government's actions. Whilst that is certainly a reasonable proposition, we have to decide whether the chancellor will have to answer to parliament or only to the head of state."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.a:0 "The chancellor will answer to the head of state and nobody else."
prussiaconstitutionngc.6.b:0 "The chancellor will also have to answer to parliament."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Pay and Perks"
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.d:0 "Some members of the constitutive Reichstag argue that we should offer pay and perks to elected delegates. Whilst this would certainly reimburse them for their efforts, we also risk creating a growing flock of career politicians that will cost the union a significant sum of money. Additionally, potentially undesired subjects, like representatives of the workers' movement, could more easily afford to occupy a seat in parliament..."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.a:0 "There will be no pay and perks for delegates."
prussiaconstitutionngc.7.b:0 "It is only fair to pay the delegates."
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.t:0 "Constitution Issue: Budget and Taxes"
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.d:0 "Since the individual states will basically continue to operate their internal matters independently, the main bulk of expenses for the union will be militarily, plus maybe a small upkeep for the central authorities and delegates, should we decide to pay them. Parliament will control and approve the budget. But how will we finance the additional expenses? Will the income from tariffs at the external borders and a share of the consumption tax suffice, or will we have to implement union taxes?"
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.a:0 "The income from tariffs and consumption tax is enough."
prussiaconstitutionngc.8.b:0 "We will impose new taxes."

prussiaconstitutionngc.11.t:0 "A Federal President - the so-called 'Bundespräsident' - Will Head the Union"

prussiaconstitutionngc.11.a:0 "Long live the president!"

prussiaconstitutionngc.14.t:0 "Member States Struggle with the Difficulties of Freedom of Movement"
prussiaconstitutionngc.14.d:0 "Although successfully implemented, the freedom of movement act does cause some problems for all of the confederation's member states. They simply fear losing control over their subjects if they can roam around so freely, plus, the question of identity checks when crossing the external borders still persists. We will need to find a solution."

prussiaconstitutionngc.15.t:0 "Unitary Measurements - the need for an Industrial Code"
prussiaconstitutionngc.15.d:0 "After implementing unitary measurements and the metric system across all member states, there still needs to be a comprehensive law regulating the way citizens can conduct their business.

Until now the exact state of merchants and trade was only vaguely defined or discussed within the government, and with the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, our nation now needs to change this. A lack of a centralised trade also represented how disunited the German states were; as the dominant German power, Prussia needs to push ahead. Reforming the drafts suggested in the Paulskirche Constitution should solidify our trade, and unite the German confederation further than before."
