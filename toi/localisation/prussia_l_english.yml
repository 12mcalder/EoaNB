### Events ###
prussia.37.t:0 "Lessons from the Austro-Sardinian War"
prussia.37.d:0 "Both, the Crimean War and the Second Italian War of Independence have proven the deficiencies of our army quite plainly. We need to think of possible reform measures."
prussia.37.a:0 "An's Werk!"
prussia.38.t:0 "Deutscher Nationalverein"
prussia.38.d:0 "The violent aggravation of the Italian struggle for unification sent shockwaves across the continent. Especially in fragmented Germany, the ideals of the nation-state fell on very fertile ground. One of the main proponents of a united German nation was founded in the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Sardinian War - the German National Association or 'Deutscher Nationalverein.' Formed by liberals and moderate democrats, the Association supported a Prussian-led German nation-state without Austria."
prussia.38.a:0 "Von der Maas bis an die Memel, von der Etsch bis an den Belt..."
prussia.39.t:0 "Proclamation of a united Italy"
prussia.39.d:0 "The proclamation of an Italian nation-state greatly influenced the German public. A growing number of people, especially among the bourgeois middle class, wholeheartedly supported the idea of a German national state. If the Italians were able to do it, why shouldn't the Germans, too?"
prussia.39.a:0 "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles..."
prussia.40.t:0 "Preußischer Volksverein"
prussia.40.d:0 "The proclamation of Italy and its subsequent recognition by Prussia once again inspired the German national movement, this time especially among the conservative clientele in the Prussian countryside. The foundation of the antiliberal, conservative Prussian People's Association or 'Preußischer Volksverein' served the purpose of bringing about a Prussian-led united Germany - by force of arms, if need be..."
prussia.40.a:0 "Über alles in der Welt!"
prussia.41.t:0 "Deutscher Reformverein"
prussia.41.d:0 "The increasing political heft of the national movement that supported a Prussian-led Germany without Austria scared a number of people, especially in the Catholic parts of western and southern Germany. Their reaction was the foundation of the Prussian 'Reformverein' that supported a reform of the German Confederation and the integration of Austria. It had little political impact, though."
prussia.41.a:0 "Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?"
prussia.42.t:0 "The New Era Cabinet - Karl Anton von Hohenzollern new PM"
prussia.42.d:0 "With the regency of Crown Prince Wilhelm came an unexpected wave of liberalism in Prussia. The crown prince, who was hitherto seen as a reactionary by many in Prussia, had spent some time at the court of Queen Victoria in liberal Great Britain after being forced to flee from Berlin amidst the March Revolution of 1848/49. The cabinet he installed after acceding regency, headed by PM Karl Anton von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, sparked hopes of a liberal wind of change."
prussia.42.a:0 "Wohlan!"
prussia.43.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV)"
prussia.43.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Supporters of the German workers' movement have gathered in Leipzig, Saxony, today to establish Germany's first labor party, the General German Workers' Association or 'Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (ADAV). Headed by a certain Ferdinand Lassalle, the party delegates predominantly support a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.43.a:0 "Mann der Arbeit, aufgewacht..."
prussia.44.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeiterverein' (VDAV)"
prussia.44.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. As a reaction to the foundation of the ADAV, supporters of a different approach within the German workers' movement have gathered in Frankfurt today to establish another labor party, the Congress of German Workers' Associations or 'Vereinstag Deutscher Arbeitervereine' (VDAV). Leopold Sonnemann, Max Hirsch and Eugen Richter are among the leaders of the new party, who - at the moment - predominantly supports a reformist socialist agenda, although the revolutionary wing is gaining power."
prussia.44.a:0 "...und erkenne deine Macht!"
prussia.45.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP)"
prussia.45.d:0 "The socialist agenda is spreading throughout Europe - and we will not be spared. Following differences primarily concerning the question of German nationalism, the VDAV was split and the majority of its supporters have gathered in Eisenach today to establish a successor labor party, the Social Democratic Workers' Party or 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei' (SDAP). August Bebel and Karl Liebknecht are among the leaders of the new party, who predominantly supports a Marxist socialist agenda."
prussia.45.a:0 "Proletarier aller Länder, vereinigt euch!"
prussia.46.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP)"
prussia.46.d:0 "The German unification made the most striking dispute between the different German labor parties obsolote. But the unity had been violently crafted under the aegis of the Prussian monarchy and military, thus, the German workers' movement awoke to the danger of being suppressed by conservative authorities. In order to strengthen their political weight, many of its supporters have gathered in Gotha today to establish a united labor party, the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany or 'Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands' (SAP), predominantly supporting a reformist socialist agenda."
prussia.46.a:0 "These socialists are becoming more and more dangerous..."
prussia.47.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD)"
prussia.47.d:0 "The Bismarckian Anti-Socialist Laws have proven that the worst fears of the German workers' movement were not unfounded. But Bismarck and the laws are a thing of the past now. The vast majority of the supporters of socialism in Germany have gathered in Erfurt today to establish a newly united labor party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany or 'Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands' (SPD), supporting a reformist socialist agenda, at least for now..."
prussia.47.a:0 "We will have to watch them very closely."

prussiaconscrisis.1.t:0 "Heeresreform Pending"
prussiaconscrisis.1.d:0 "It has become obvious that our armed forces do not meet Prussian standards anymore, an army reform is inevitable. Should we also order weapons and uniforms to facilitate the recruitment of new divisions?"

prussiaconscrisis.9.t:0 "Budget Approved Provisionally Again"
prussiaconscrisis.9.d:0 "The proposed reforms continue to be accompanied by significant expenses. We once again have to get parliamentary approval for this year's budget.

The delegates are still uncertain about his intentions, but they feel reaffirmed in their prejudices against the alleged conservative agitator Bismarck."

prussiaconscrisis.27.t:0 "Another Parliament Dissolution - Bismarck Governs without a Budget"
prussiaconscrisis.27.d:0 "The king seems to be tieing his fate to that of Bismarck. After the majority of delegates reassured the prime minister that they would not change their minds on the pending army reform budget, the king has once again dissolved parliament.

prussiaconscrisis.28.t:0 "Alvensleben Convention"
prussiaconscrisis.28.d:0 "Russia is currently dealing with an Uprising in their Polish territories.

We could use this situation to our advantage and come to good terms with the Russians, which may help us in the future. After all, a Polish state right at our border would be a welcome ally to any potential foe."
prussiaconscrisis.28.a:0 "This will strengthen our relationship with Russia."
prussiaconscrisis.28.b:0 "Cancel the proposed convention!"
prussiaconscrisis.29.t:0 "Danziger Episode"
prussiaconscrisis.29.d:0 "The restriction of press freedom does not have many supporters in Germany, not even all members of the closest royal family agree with it. Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm spoke to the press this morning during his official visit in Danzig. Although very cautious, his words did express a sense of criticism against his father, King Wilhelm I. This will certainly have repercussions."
prussiaconscrisis.29.a:0 "How dare he?!"
prussiaconscrisis.30.t:0 "Foundation of the Nationalliberale Partei (NLP)"
prussiaconscrisis.30.d:0 "The question of indemnity, in this case meaning the subsequent legitimization of a previously enforced political action, has divided the liberal movement. Whereas the DFP delegates predominantly rejected the bill, more right-leaning liberals voted in favor. The latter have now formed a political assembly of their own: the National Liberal Party, or 'Nationalliberale Partei' (NLP). Maybe the chancellor will be able to work together with the liberals at least in part after all."
prussiaconscrisis.30.a:0 "Wohlan!"

prussiaforeign.6.t:0 "Prussia's Inquiry for the Purchase of Warships"
prussiaforeign.6.d:0 "The Prussians have approached us with an offer to buy two warships for their navy. If we agree, our mutual relationship will be strenghtened and we will profit from the money they offer. If we refuse, however, our relationship with the Prussians will be strained for some time."
prussiaforeign.6.a:0 "Accept their offer."
prussiaforeign.6.b:0 "Refuse their offer."

prussiaelection.1.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1858"
prussiaelection.1.d:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1858 have taken place and the final results came in a few minutes ago. The liberal-leaning New Era cabinet has emerged from the election even stronger, and it seems like the liberal ideology is on the rise for now..."
prussiaelection.1.a:0 "Okay."
prussiaelection.2.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1861"
prussiaelection.2.d:0 "The parliamentary elections of 1861 have taken place and the final results came in a few minutes ago. The delegates of the liberal parties have emerged as winners. It seems that the liberal turn in Prussia will continue..."
prussiaelection.2.a:0 "Okay."
prussiaelection.3.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1862 - Major Liberal Victory"
prussiaelection.3.d:0 "Following the dissolution of parliament, there had to be new elections. Despite hope from the king and significant electoral corruption, the Prussian people have once again expressed their support for liberal ideals; the conservatives' campaign efforts seem to have been in vain. The conservative government will certainly have a very hard time pushing their policies and legislation through parliament now..."
prussiaelection.3.a:0 "Gottverdammt!"
prussiaelection.4.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1862 - Liberal Victory"
prussiaelection.4.d:0 "Following the dissolution of parliament, there had to be new elections. Despite hope from the king and significant electoral corruption, the Prussian people have once again expressed their support for liberal ideals, but the conservatives might have been able to cut their losses. Nevertheless, the government will certainly have a hard time pushing their policies and legislation through parliament now..."
prussiaelection.4.a:0 "Verdammt!"
prussiaelection.5.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1862 - Minor Liberal Victory"
prussiaelection.5.d:0 "Following the dissolution of parliament, there had to be new elections. Despite hope from the king and significant electoral corruption, the Prussian people have once again expressed their support for liberal ideals, but the conservatives might have been able to cut their losses pretty significantly. Although the government might still have a hard time pushing their policies and legislation through parliament, there is reason to hope."
prussiaelection.5.a:0 "Nun gut."
prussiaelection.6.t:0 "Parliamentary Elections of 1863"
prussiaelection.6.d:0 "Although it bought the conservative government precious time, the 'closure' of parliament left an unpleasent vacuum, even by Bismarckian standards. New elections could not suspended indefinitely, and so the men of Prussia again headed to the polls, five months after parliament had been shut down. Unsurprisingly, the liberal movement emerged victorious once more."
prussiaelection.6.a:0 "Is this the end for Bismarck?"

Despite a rapidly growing population, our standing army is still the same size it was in 1815. We need to reform the army, if we want to keep our place among the great powers."
PRS_parlamentsheer:0 "Parlamentsheer"
PRS_parlamentsheer_desc:0 "We must strengthen parliamentary control over the military. The law has to take precedence over power, we should reform the army in this spirit."

PRS_roon_reform_bill_desc:0 "Albrecht von Roon has suggested some reforms for our armies. We shall enact them."
PRS_promote_landwehr:0 "Promote Landwehr"
PRS_strengthen_landwehr_desc:0 "The Landwehr has been the backbone of the Befreiungskriege against Napoleon, and it offered great assistance in our attempt of constitutionalization in 1848/49. This is our opportunity to inculcate liberal ideals into the military. This will certainly provoke a conservative backlash, though..." 
PRS_demote_landwehr:0 "Demote Landwehr"
PRS_demote_landwehr_desc:0 "Many members of the Landwehr collaborated with the rebels during the March Revolution of 1848/49. We should demote this unreliable department of our military juggernaut in favor of the regular army. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_adjust_draft:0 "Adjust Two-Year Draft"
PRS_adjust_draft_desc:0 "If we enforce the conscription orders more strictly, we might be able to avoid extending the term of service. This might be a way to secure both, a majority in parliament and support from the king."
PRS_expand_draft:0 "Three-Year Draft"
PRS_expand_draft_desc:0 "We need more soldiers, plain and simple. Extending the term of service would ensure a significant increase in manpower for our professional army. This will certainly provoke liberal opposition, though..."
PRS_push_liberal_reform:0 "Push Liberal Reform Bill Through Parliament"
PRS_push_liberal_reform_desc:0 "Parliamentary control over the military is the way forward, the people have spoken. The king may not like this, but he will have to accept the majority decision - or face the consequences!"
PRS_find_compromise:0 "Find Compromise"
PRS_find_compromise_desc:0 "The demotion of the Landwehr and the adjustment of our conscription laws should be an acceptable compromise to parliament and high command. Let's hope the king agrees..."
PRS_enforce_roon_reform:0 "Enforce Roon's Reform Bill"
PRS_enforce_roon_reform_desc:0 "The military is answerable to the king only, not to parliament. These men have proven their loyalty to the crown during the revolution and we will make sure that it stays this way. There can be no compromise here!"

PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament:0 "Dissolution of Parliament"
PRS_focus_dissolve_parliament_desc:0 "We have maneuvered into crisis. Decisive action is required to overcome the political standstill and to continue the army reform. The Prussian parliament is ineffective in that regard, which leads to political problems - we must shake the situation up by dissolving it!"
PRS_king_deposed:0 "The King's Deposition"
PRS_king_deposed_desc:0 "It is time to shake off the shackles of monarchy and take the matters of state into our own trustworthy hands. The king has proven to be unable to reason and compromise. He must go, once and for all!"
PRS_king_abdicates:0 "The King's Abdication"
PRS_king_abdicates_desc:0 "Tired of the ongoing power struggle with parliament, Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, abdicates in favor of his son Friedrich III, who has signalled his willingness to find a compromise with the liberals."
PRS_focus_bismarck:0 "Konfliktminister Bismarck"
PRS_focus_bismarck_desc:0 "Our situation is dire, the king is slowly starting to lose patience. If we want to preserve the Prussia our ancestors created, we need someone willing to confront parliament - a conservative hardliner. War minister von Roon mentioned a promising candidate who currently serves us in Paris..."  
PRS_befriend_russia:0 "Befriend Russia"
PRS_befriend_russia_desc:0 "The Russians have helped us in fighting off Napoléon, the legacy of the Holy Alliance still subsists between our nations. Having them on our side or keeping them neutral in any future conflict will be paramount to our success. We can also make use of Bismarck's connections with St. Petersburg."
PRS_contest_austria:0 "Contest Austria's Präsidialmacht"
PRS_contest_austria_desc:0 "Despite a rather underdeveloped economy, their internal struggles as a multi-national empire, and their failure in the Sardinian War, the Austrians still claim presidency over all other members of the German Confederation. We are no longer willing to accept this and demand equal status!"

PRS_focus_shut_parliament:0 "Shut Down Parliament"
PRS_focus_shut_parliament_desc:0 "Parliament continues to oppose the budget for the army reform. On top of that, they have repeatedly demanded the Prime Minister's demission. We could find a way to circumvent obstacles in the constitution and simply shut the parliament's doors to avoid new elections. This won't last long, but it would certainly buy us time."
PRS_austria_no_zollverein:0 "Keep Austria Out of the Zollverein"
PRS_austria_no_zollverein_desc:0 "The Austrians have repeatedly asked for their German-speaking territories to be attached to the Zollverein. They try to pressure the South German states into forcing our hand, but we must stay strong and keep Austria out of the Zollverein at all costs, if we want to strive for dominance in Germany."
PRS_convenient_alliance:0 "An Alliance of Convenience"
PRS_convenient_alliance_desc:0 "Our victory in the Second Schleswig War has reinvigorated the German national movement - and Prussia is their biggest hope. Many liberals also want to see Germany unified. Maybe we can use this as leverage to weaken the liberal opposition against our government."
PRS_focus_ask_for_indemnitat:0 "Indemnitätsvorlage"
PRS_focus_ask_for_indemnitat_desc:0 "The army reform proved to be very effective. Our rivals had to sue for peace and we have cemented Prussia's hegemony over Germany. Now it's time to come to terms with the internal opposition. The success of our measures swayed a number of liberals in our favor and we could offer them the promise of a unified Germany. This way, we might be able to divide the liberal movement..."
PRS_focus_bismarcksche_verfassung:0 "Bismarcksche Verfassung"
PRS_focus_bismarcksche_verfassung_desc:0 "The Bismarckian Constitution for the North German Confederation is one of the most advanced constitutions of its time. It grants all male citizens the right to vote and abandons the former Prussian three-class franchise in favor of universal franchise. It might also be a useful foundation for a future constitution of a united Germany, if it ever comes to this."
