 qing.3.t:0 "An Official Flag"
 qing.3.d:0 "Your Majesty, it has lately come to our attention that a lack of a proper official flag for our nation has made our encounters with foreigners difficult. Already a few years ago a Chinese ship called by the Westeners the 'HMS Arrow' was forced to fly the British flag due to us not having a flag. This led to our capturing of the ship, but due to flying the British flag, we gave the British an excuse to attack us. In order to avoid such a misunderstanding in the future we should adopt a national flag according to Western designs. It has been proposed that our new flag will be triangular in order to avoid any confusion with the Eigth Banners rectangular flags. The flag will feature the traditional symbols of Your Majesty, the Five-clawed Dragon and the Flaming Pearl."

Accordingly, Lee began construction of his residence in 1860 under Imperial blessing, and has now finished his work this year. \n \nThe residence has been built in the traditional Hakka style, consisting of two main rooms and four side buildings, guarded by a semi-circular pool and a whitewashed wall of mud brick.
