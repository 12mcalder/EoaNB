 ROM_END_OF_NEW_BEG_DESC:0 "Wallachia and of course, Moldovia, are in a state of change. Not long ago, in 1834, the phanariot rule came to an end and local nobles became princes of the two principalities but this was only a small success for the Romanians. In 1848, the age of revolutions, a revolutionary government was defeated by the Ottomans and the monarchy was reinstaurated. The last prince of Wallachia, Barbu Ştirbey, named for 7 years(from 1849 to 1856) ended his reign exactly at the end of the Crimean War, and the Ottomans rejected a longer reign due to his unionist sentiment, a sentiment the people also have. Now the former prince A.D Ghika is camimacan (regent) of Wallachia, and he is a supporter of the unionist cause and a great reformer, tho Moldavia is in a different case..."
