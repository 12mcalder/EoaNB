All lands to the north of these rivers will be handed over to the Russians, as well as the coveted lands to the east of the Ussuri and Sungacha Rivers, down to the area of the Hunchun and Tumen Rivers nearest Korea, cutting off our realm's northern border to the Sea of Japan. Additionally, a clause was added stating 'Russian merchants in China, and Chinese merchants in Russia were under the special protection of both governments,' removing any trade barriers in the region. Finally, since it was agreed that all lands east of the Ussuri would now be considered Russian territories, our ancient claims to the Island of Sakhalin must be rescinded. Such tremendous losses bodes ill for the future welfare of China."

    russiaalas.1.t:0 "The Summer Garden"
    russiaalas.1.d:0 "Alexander II leisurely paced through the picturesque Summer Garden, within the Palace Embankment in St. Petersburg. Flocked by a large entourage of noblemen and attendants, Alexander only found a certain amount of reprieve for himself from the crowd when he stood to gaze, captivated, upon the beauty of some of the oldest fountains to be found in all of Russia.\n\nAs the Emperor’s tour of Peter the Great’s creation drew to a close, he made his way toward the large gate that marked the entrance of the Garden, stopping to remark at its fine artistry as a crowd of onlookers began to assemble around him."

    russiaalas.2.t:0 "Attempt on the Emperor's Life - Summer Garden"
    russiaalas.2.d:0 "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nAlexander jolted about when he heard the discharge of the weapon. He was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary’s attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter’s apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary’s arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him, and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him “What do you want?” The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him “Nothing, nothing,” before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students’ organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

    russiaalas.3.d_1:0 "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nThe beloved Emperor collapsed into the hands of his attendants as the impact of the shotgun shells ripped into his chest, spilling blood all over his uniform and the noblemen around him. The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition of Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak. Although the doctors attending to him tried everything in their power to stop the bleeding, the Emperor took his last breath just as his carriage screeched to a halt outside of his residence. The Tsar is no more."
