    russiaalas.1.d:0 "Alexander II leisurely paced through the picturesque Summer Garden, within the Palace Embankment in St. Petersburg. Flocked by a large entourage of noblemen and attendants, Alexander only found a certain amount of reprieve for himself from the crowd when he stood to gaze, captivated, upon the beauty of some of the oldest fountains to be found in all of Russia.\n\nAs the Emperor’s tour of Peter the Great’s creation drew to a close, he made his way toward the large gate that marked the entrance of the Garden, stopping to remark at its fine artistry as a crowd of onlookers began to assemble around him."

    russiaalas.2.d:0 "Unbeknownst to Alexander II and his entourage, a young revolutionary slipped through the crowd that had gathered around him at the gate of the St. Petersburg Summer Garden. In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nAlexander jolted about when he heard the discharge of the weapon. He was still alive. Luckily, at just the right moment, the revolutionary’s attempt was thwarted by the valiant interruption of no other than a peasant-born hatter’s apprentice by the name of Ossip Komissarov, who jostled the revolutionary’s arm just as he was about to fire.\n\nThe assailant, shocked by Komissarov, attempted to flee the scene, but he was immediately intercepted by the royal guard. The guards wrested his weapon away from him, and confiscated what appeared to be morphine and strychnine to kill himself with, along with prussic acid to disfigure his face. Alexander approached the assailant, and angrily asked him “What do you want?” The shocked assailant only mumbled back to him “Nothing, nothing,” before being taken away.\n\nThe identity of the assailant has been revealed to be Dmitry Karakozov, a former student and a member of the revolutionary students’ organization known as the Ishutin Society, led by Nikolai Ishutin. He has been locked away in the Peter and Paul Fortress awaiting his punishment, but he begs for forgiveness and even offers to convert to Orthodoxy."

In a desperate attempt, the revolutionary pulled out a double-barreled shotgun and trained his aim at the Emperor...and fired.\n\nThe beloved Emperor collapsed into the hands of his attendants as the impact of the shotgun shells ripped into his chest, spilling blood all over his uniform and the noblemen around him. The assailant ducked his weapon back into his coat and attempted to flee the scene, but was quickly accosted by the guards and taken away.\n\nAs the crowds gathered around to gaze in horror at their wounded Emperor, the guards desperately attempted to disperse the crowds as a carriage rode up to take him away to the Winter Palace. As the carriage fled the scene, the condition of Alexander worsened severely, as he began to cough up blood and grow extremely pale and weak. Although the doctors attending to him tried everything in their power to stop the bleeding, the Emperor took his last breath just as his carriage screeched to a halt outside of his residence. The Tsar is no more."

    russiavicfocus.2.d:0 "The Crimean War was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. The war started in the Balkans in July 1853, when Russian troops occupied the Danubian Principalities, which were under Ottoman suzerainty, then began to cross the Danube. Led by Omar Pasha, the Ottomans fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the advance at Silistra. The Crimean War was one of the first conflicts in which the military used modern technologies such as explosive naval shells, railways and telegraphs. The war was one of the first to be documented extensively in written reports and photographs. As the legend of the "Charge of the Light Brigade" demonstrates, the war quickly became an iconic symbol of logistical, medical and tactical failures and mismanagement."

Now we have to consider new reforms to improve it.  \n\nAfter the Russian defeat in the Crimean War, the Minister of War, Count Dmitry Milyutin, (who held the post from 16 May 1861 to 21 May 1881) introduced many much-needed reforms. The reforms carried on during Milyutin's long tenure abolished the system where children were conscripted, and resulted in the levy system being introduced in Russia and military districts being created across the country. The system of military education was also reformed, and elementary education was made available to all the draftees. Milyutin's reforms are regarded as a milestone in the history of Russia: they dispensed with the military recruitment and professional army introduced by Peter the Great and created the Russian army such as it continued into the 21st century. Up to Dmitry Milyutin's reforms in 1874 the Russian Army had no permanent barracks and was billeted in dugouts and shacks."
