 RYU_the_veil_of_independance_desc:0 "Though technically under the control of Satsuma, Ryukyu was given a great degree of autonomy. To best serve the interests of the Satsuma daimyō and the shogunate, an emphasis on trade with China was instated. Ryukyu was a tributary state of China, and since Japan had no formal diplomatic relations with China, it was essential that China not realize that Ryukyu was controlled by Japan. Thus, Satsuma—and the shogunate—were obliged to be mostly hands-off in terms of not visibly or forcibly occupying Ryukyu or controlling the policies and laws there."
