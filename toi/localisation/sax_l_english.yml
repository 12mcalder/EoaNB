SAX_napoleonic_war_defeat_desc:0 "Saxony suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Leipzig in the Napoleonic Wars. Thousands of troops deserted to the enemy side, adding upon the thousands of casualties. The Saxon countryside was destroyed and the new King was taken prisoner by the Prussians. The Saxon military and their state as well would not easily recover from the defeat in the war as a new Kingdom."

SAX_anti_prussian_sentiments_desc:0 "Just over 40 years ago, Prussia stripped away 60% of Saxon territory as a result of the Congress of Vienna. Prussia was barely stopped from annexing the entire nation, it is clear they have little regard for the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Saxony. The Napoleonic Wars turned Prussia into Europe’s superpower, and their clear ambitions to unite all German states is most retrograde to Saxon existence."
SAX_ethnic_tensions:0 "Sorbian Tensions"
SAX_ethnic_tensions_desc:0 "Saxony is not a kingdom composed solely of ethnic Germans. A small slavic minority, the Sorbs, are the occupants of the province of Upper Lusatia. Lusatia, once an independent nation, is now the source of ethnic tensions within Saxony. For centuries, Saxons have forcibly assimilated Sorbs through a destruction of Sorbian culture, literature and language. Recently, the Sorbs have become more boisterous, thousands of them call for an end to the assimilation, and the tensions now risk boiling over."
