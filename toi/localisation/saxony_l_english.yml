#General Events
saxony.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Domestic Policy"
saxony.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] has been heavily involved in the revolutionary uprisings of 1830 and 1848/49. Public pressure mainly exerted by intellectuals and academics in Leipzig and Dresden led to the adoption of a relatively progressive constitution in 1831, which turned the kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, including public elections for the second chamber of the Landtag.\n\nIn the meantime, the [SAX.GetName] was the first country in Germany to experience the rapid changes brought about by the industrial revolution. Primarily around the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau, a large number of factories were built, mainly specialized in the textile and mechanical engineering industry. With that arose a new social class: the industrial proletariat, which grew increasingly unhappy with the poor labor conditions and a lack of political representation.\n\nFueled by general unhappiness and high unemployment, Saxony was one of the centers of the March Revolution of 1848/49. Violent outbursts forced the king to change the government multiple times, appoint more progressive ministers, end press censorship, and liberalize suffrage laws. As the forces of reaction tried to take back control, bloody street battles ensued after the king had dissolved the Landtag and Prussian troops intervened in Dresden, leaving several hundreds dead. The forces loyal to the crown eventually prevailed, and most of the concessions were revoked.\n\n[SAX.GetNameDef] now finds itself at a crossroads. Whilst aristocrats are clinging on to their privileges, the public demands progress and liberalization, and there's also the question how to handle growing nationalist sentiments among the Sorbs. It will be important to find a balance, develop our economy, and ensure another revolt is prevented, if we want Saxony to thrive and prosper."

#Foreign Policy
saxonyforeign.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Saxony –\nStarting Situation: Foreign Affairs"
saxonyforeign.1.d:0 "\n[SAX.GetNameDef] is in a difficult position geographically. Sandwiched between the two German hegemons, the [PRS.GetName] and the [AUS.GetName], and bordering the third German power, the [BAV.GetName] to the south, the government will have to tread carefully, especially on the international stage.\n\nWhilst membership in the Zollverein is of vital economic importance, our relationship to the Zollverein's leading power, Prussia, has not been the greatest. In fact, Saxony had nearly been annexed completely by the [PRS.GetName] during the Vienna Congress of 1815, as a punishment for siding with Napoleon until the last minute.\n\nOnly the intervention of the [AUS.GetName] prevented the complete incorporation of our kingdom into the Prussian state back then, but we still lost over half of our territory and nearly 40% of our population as part of the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna. The days when we were considered a European middle power are over, and we only barely managed to prevent the Prussian unification initiative after the March Revolution, known as the Erfurt Union.\n\nWe will have to decide how to proceed from here. We made some promising progress working with the other German minors lately and continuing down this path should be our best option, although it might be hard to get all parties involved on the same page. At the same time we should be careful not to antagonize Austria and Prussia, or our days as an independent country could be numbered..."

#Country Leader Descriptions
SAX_FERDINAND_VON_ZSCHINSKY_LEADER_DESC:0 "Having studied and worked as a lawyer in the private, public, and aristocratic spheres, Ferdinand von Zschinsky served a two-week stint as the head of Saxony’s Ministry of the Interior in 1848 before being appointed leader of the Saxon government by King Friedrich August II in 1849.\n\nFerdinand’s leadership has been ideologically mixed; one of his government’s first actions was the dissolution of the Saxon State Parliament and the reinstatement of the less liberal 1831 constitution, (a major reversal of concessions made in the wake of the 1848 revolutions) but on the other hand he has also stripped feudal landlords of their legal jurisdiction and separated the powers of the state and judiciary.\n\nWhile his time in office has been consequential for Saxony, Ferdinand von Zschinsky is in ailing health, and he likely does not have much more time to lead."
