  carlistbalears.1.t:0 "Jaime Ortega´s Carlist Expedition"
  carlistbalears.1.d:0 "General Jaime Ortega, captain general of the Balear Islands, has sailed from Mallorca and intends to land in San Carlos de La Rápita. With him comes an expeditionary brigade of soldiers, and many disloyal commanders in the Basque provinces and the Viceroyalty of Navarre, as well as the northern parts of Aragon are ready to rise against Queen Isabella II once the order is given. Jaime has an issue though, that his expeditionary brigade doesn´t know his intentions, and this could end very badly for him once they become aware of the situation."
  carlistbalears.1.a:0 "Let´s wait for the soldiers´ reaction"
  carlistbalears.2.t:0 "The Ortegada has succeeded!"
