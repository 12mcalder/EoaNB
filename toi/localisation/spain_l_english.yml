  carlistbalears.1.t:0 "Jaime Ortega´s Carlist Expedition"
  carlistbalears.1.d:0 "General Jaime Ortega, captain general of the Balear Islands, has sailed from Mallorca and intends to land in San Carlos de La Rápita. With him comes an expeditionary brigade of soldiers, and many disloyal commanders in the Basque provinces and the Viceroyalty of Navarre, as well as the northern parts of Aragon are ready to rise against Queen Isabella II once the order is given. Jaime has an issue though, that his expeditionary brigade doesn´t know his intentions, and this could end very badly for him once they become aware of the situation."
  carlistbalears.1.a:0 "Let´s wait for the soldiers´ reaction"
  carlistbalears.2.t:0 "The Ortegada has succeeded!"
  carlistbalears.2.d:0 "The soldiers have given full support to Jaime Ortega, and with the permission of the abade general the revolution has begun! Already hundreds of disloyal to Isabella II have risen and there are riots in the streets of Madrid. Our old generals have been recalled and we are readying ourselves for the conflict."
  carlistbalears.2.a:0 "¡Viva Isabel II!"
  carlistbalears.2.b:0 "¡Viva el rey legítimo!"
  carlistbalears.3.t:0 "The Ortegada fails"
  carlistbalears.3.d:0 "It seems like the soldiers realised what they were getting into and ordered Ortega to return to Mallorca. His patriotic speech failed miserably and they themselves captured him and some of his supporters. The other heads of the revolt have gone into the shadows again, plotting for the next rebellion."
  carlistbalears.3.a:0 "Hang the traitor!"
  carlistbalears.4.t:0 "The Third Carlist War"
  carlistbalears.4.d:0 "Spain has descended yet again into the realm of madness and civil war, after the Carlists have risen again for the 3rd time in less than 50 years."
  carlistbalears.4.a:0 "Carlists again? How many more times will they try?"
