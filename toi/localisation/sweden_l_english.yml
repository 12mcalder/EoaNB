###Focuses###
 SWE_economy:0 "The Swedish Economy"
 SWE_economy_desc:0 "Economics is the art to meet unlimited needs with scarce resources, and studying it is the root to all prosperity. We need to address the issues facing our country not just from abroad, but from home as well."
 SWE_develop_oslo:0 "Develop Oslo"
 SWE_develop_oslo_desc:0 "Oslo is one of the newer acquisitions of our great homeland, joining us following the Swedish–Norwegian War of 1814. We should focus our efforts on improving Norway, let's think of it as a warm welcome into the Swedish Fatherland"
 SWE_develop_gothenburg:0 "Develop Gothenburg"
 SWE_develop_gothenburg_desc:0 "Gothenburg is an old and proud city, and the largest port in Scandinavia. Originally founded as a Trading Colony for the Dutch, it has grown into the second-largest city in Sweden, and become economically irreplaceable. Focusing our efforts on developing Gothenburg is a very sensible choice."
 SWE_develop_karlskrona:0 "Develop Karlskrona"
 SWE_develop_karlskrona_desc:0 "Karlskrona is a small city, but its strategic and historical importance is incalculable. It is the main base of the Royal Swedish Navy, and the Base of Operations for the Coast Guard. It has an exceptionally well-sheltered location: arcs of islands provide a strong defense not only from the sea but also from land attacks. Developing it is, at least as far as the Navy is concerned, a no-brainer"
 SWE_develop_stockholm:0 "Develop Stockholm"
 SWE_develop_stockholm_desc:0 "Stockholm is the largest city in Scandinavia and the Capital of Sweden. That's all that needs to be said. Developing Stockholm is as obvious as it gets."
 SWE_nor_fish:0 "Tax cuts for the fishing industry"
 SWE_nor_fish_desc:0 "It has been said that fishing is the lifeblood of nations, and we would be foolish to not fully exploit our vast natural resources just off our coast. We should dedicate at least a few weeks to trying to strengthen our Fishing Industry, it could prove very worthwhile!"
 SWE_got_inf:0 "Appropriate funds to Infrastructure"
 SWE_got_inf_desc:0 "Infrastructure may not be a very interesting thing to invest money in, but it is plainly necessary for a Modern Nation to function efficiently. Gothenburgs infrastructure should be expanded to keep up with the rapid growth of the city"
 SWE_got_ports:0 "Expansion of the Gothenburg harbour"
 SWE_got_ports_desc:0 "Gothenburg may have the largest port in Scandinavia, but is there ever truly such a thing as \"large enough\"? I don't think so! More ports, more Dockyards, Gothenburg will need to expand to keep up with the demands of the Modern world!"
 SWE_got_docks:0 "Municipalise Gothenburg's dockyards"
 SWE_got_docks_desc:0 "Dockyards, Ports, Dry Docks, Wharfs, we need all of them! Gothenburg is the perfect candidate for an expansion of our ship-building capabilities, an expansion which is long overdue"
 SWE_eu_trade:0 "Formalise trade treaties with the Great Powers"
 SWE_eu_trade_desc:0 "Trade is the mother of money. We have timber, iron, steel, and a large quantity of rare elements such as gold and tungsten, all of which are in great demand throughout the continent. Establishing official trade relations with the European Great Powers could prove extremely beneficial for our economy"
 SWE_got_convoys:0 "Purchase foreign ships"
 SWE_got_convoys_desc:0 "If we are to commit heavily to trade, we need something to move all the exports and imports with. Convoys that is. We can use some time and money to get more convoys, through requisitioning, upgrading, and purchasing"
 SWE_got_yacht_club:0 "Cooperate with Amateur Sailors"
 SWE_got_yacht_club_desc:0 "Never underestimate the value of Amateurs! These people have a passion for sailing and the ocean, each and everyone has spent thousands of hours out on the seas, they know what they're talking about, and it would be very wise to try to integrate their experience into the Navy"
 SWE_ocean_fleet:0 "Atlantic Navy"
 SWE_ocean_fleet_desc:0 "Ever since Norway joined our homeland, we've been faced by the new issue of the Atlantic. Through most of our history, our Navy has been strictly confined to the Baltic Sea but, now, to protect our far larger coast, we need to expand it to be able to operate in the Atlantic as well."
 SWE_karl_coal:0 "Incentivise investments in coal"
 SWE_karl_coal_desc:0 "Coal is horrendously important in the days of Modern Industries, and we should put an effort into expanding our coal mines, Scania in particular has a few good potential spots"
 SWE_karl_inf:0 "Expand the railways in Scania"
 SWE_karl_inf_desc:0 "Having good roads is never a bad thing, but some places require them more than others, and situated at the very southern tip of our nation, Scania in particular could really benefit from some Infrastructural upgrades"
 SWE_karl_civ_factory:0 "Replace farmers with machines"
 SWE_karl_civ_factory_desc:0 "Scanian Industry"
 SWE_baltic_trade:0 "Formalise trade treaties with our neighbours" 
 SWE_baltic_trade_desc:0 "Trade is a very important aspect of our economy, and the overwhelming majority of our exports go across the Baltic straight to our ol' neighbours. We have so many old trade treaties that we never bothered to renew, and all manner of new ones that we just never got around to formalising. Why not spend the money to hire a few extra bureaucrats to take care of all the paperwork so we can increase trade? We'll make back the money tenfold!"
 SWE_karl_logging:0 "Exploit the forests of Smolandia"
 SWE_karl_logging_desc:0 "Exploit the forests of Smolandia"
 SWE_karl_mil_factory:0 "Subsidise new arms factories"
 SWE_karl_mil_factory_desc:0 "The southern tip of Sweden has a long history of arms producing, but many factories of said arms have been forced to close down in the recent decades following the outbreak of peace. But if you want peace, prepare for war! We should bring these arms factories back by giving them new, alluring, government contracts"

 SWE_swe_factories_desc:0 "There are many proposals sitting on our desks detailing all kinds of projects, from humble upgrades to ambitious new creations. The Industrial Era is taking the rest of the World by storm, we should subsidise some of these plans to try to keep up with everyone else."
 SWE_swe_coal:0 "Fund the development of the Coal industry"
 SWE_swe_coal_desc:0 "There’s coal in them thar hills!!!\n Coal is the unglamorous hero of the 19th century! It may not shine like gold, or perfectly adorn necklaces like pearls, but it can do something that none of those precious minerals can do, it can power ships and factories! The English have a near-monopoly on coal production, and it would serve us very well if we could become more self-reliant when it came to our energy needs"
 SWE_swe_lumber:0 "Approve tax-cuts for the Forestry industry"
 SWE_swe_lumber_desc:0 "Like it or not, quid pro quos are the way the world works. We scratch their back and they scratch ours. The forestry industry assures us that they will expand their business, creating more job and more exports, ultimately strengthening the economy, if we do a favour for them and cut their taxes."
 SWE_swe_men:0 "Fund a rewened recruitment drive"
 SWE_swe_men_desc:0 "\"You there! Do your duty for King and Fatherland, enlist today! Unless you're a coward, that is?\" \nSpreading some propaganda phamplets across the cities ought to remind the lower classes of their duty to our Fatherland! This new recruitment drive will doubtlessly drive thousands to the recruitment office. Calling people who don't want to die cowards always work, it's the oldest trick in the book!"

Being owned, and therefore financed, by the wealthiest aristocrat in the Kingdom, they were traditionally better trained and equipped than their provincial counterparts. Though the centralisation of recent years mean that all regiments are owned and financed by the state, these regiments are still considered to be the more prestigious units in the Swedish Army, and are often personally commanded by the King in battle. Now more than ever, we need these units to enter the fray. With some... Gentle persuasion, we might be able to convince the King to resign his command, and appoint a far more competent Colonel in his stead. The Second-in-Command of the Life Regiment Hussars, Carl Herman Leuheusen, is a popular candidate"

Undoubtedly the result of the Kingdom having spent several decades attacking everything in sight. As a remedy for this issue Charles XI introduced the Allotment System: By localising finances and streamlining the recruitment process, this new system promised to alleviate the recruitment issue and, combined with various other reforms, modernise the Swedish Army, turning it into a relentless war-machine that would, when next faced with a foreign invasion, spend two decades destroying every enemy army in sight. \n\nThe legacy of Charles XI and his caroleans lives on strongly in Sweden, and we should change our Army to reflect what it was 150 years ago: An unstoppable war-machine"

It is true that with the exception of Sweden there is no country in Europe which is situated like Russia\" \n– Carl von Clausewitz \nTrading land for time is an old proven tactic. Falling back and letting the enemy overextend their supply lines, all while constantly harassing those very same lines, using baits and traps to lure the enemy deeper and deeper into the country until you can finally close in and annihilate them. Sweden is uniquely positioned for this kind of warfare and we'd be foolish not to take advantage of it."

Above all, the soldiers must go-on. They must continue advancing, continue attacking, no matter what. When you don't have the numbers to win a fight determined by pure firepower, you need to change the rules of the fight to favour you. And you do that by getting up close and personal, using speed and maneuverability to outflank and then destroy your foe."

Shock tactics are absolutely vital for our success on the battlefield; We don't have the luxuary of just beating the enemy, we need to beat them quickly, or else we'll lose too many men to be able to fight again.

 eoanb_sweden.0.d:0 "The Year is 1857 in the year of our Lord, and the Triple Crowns of the Swedish Kingdom stand at a fork in the road. On one hand lies the path to greatness and prosperity, and on the other, the road to death and ruin. "
 eoanb_sweden.0.a:0 "King and Fatherland!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.1.t:0 "The Municipal Reforms of [GetYear]"
 eoanb_sweden.1.d:0 "Ever since the 1520s, cities and parishes in Sweden have been ruled to a near-dictatorial extent by Mayors undemocratically appointed by the Privy Council in Stockholm. This has been subject to heavy criticism with accusations of corruption, quid pro quos, and partisan bias being ever present. The heavy-handed approach of many frankly unqualified mayors has resulted in a general feeling of disenfranchisement among the peasantry. Public outcry demanding that Mayors be democratically elected and for Local Parliaments to be established have grown deafening, and many legislators have begun seriously discussing a widespread reform to address these issues. \n\nThe Current Consensus proposes that Parishes be abolished as juicidal regions entirely, and the country instead be divided into Municipalities, the size of which will be determined by population and area. Each municipality will have its own parliament of democratically elected representatives who are tasked to oversee the day-to-day business of the region. The Mayor, in this new system, will see his power signifcantly curtailed and will serve as little more than a figurehead. \n\nProponents of this reform argue that not only are these changes prinicipally justified for our society to be truly free, but also that it will decrease corruption and, with power distributed among many people rather than one, will result in a more competent administration. By abolishing parishes, we would also take steps in the direction of secularisation, where competancy is higher valued than your ability to cite scripture, the argument goes. \n\nOpponents cite tradition, arguing that it is wildly disrespectful to go against three centuries of heritage because some peasants feel repressed. With power based on local elections rather than Government Appointments, this also stands to challenge the more authoritarian minded of society."
 eoanb_sweden.1.a:0 "The Peasants are acting like spoiled children, we'll give them nothing."
 eoanb_sweden.1.b:0 "The current system is unsustainable, we need these reforms."
 
 eoanb_sweden.2.t:0 "The Trial of the Six"
 eoanb_sweden.2.d:0 "Shock and Scandal is rocking the Kingdom following a very controversial court ruling in the capital. Six women are standing trial for heresy because of their Catholic faith. \n\nThe Kingdom of Sweden has had an extremely strong association with Luthernism and Protestantism ever since the days of the Thirty Years' War and Gustavus Adolphus the Great, and Catholicism has been forcefully rejected by the nation for hundreds of years. \n\nBut be that as it may, some people argue that the very reason Gustavus Adolphus the Great intervened in the Thirty Years' War in the first place was to protect religious freedom, and that the right to believe in any of the numerous interpretations of the Bible and Jesus Christ is the right of every Swedish citizen. The French and Spanish Embassies have also made a formal protest to the Government over this trial, calling it outrageous, and asking the Government to consider pardoning them. \n\nThe Government is facing a difficult call; Pardon the women, and trample all over the legal system, or, allow the Court to banish them, and risk angering the Catholics of Europe."

 eoanb_sweden.3.t:0 "Lumber Boom!"
 eoanb_sweden.3.d:0 "Wood, wood, wood! This may be a time of Steam and Steel, but the importance of lumber is perhaps greater than ever before! And, luckily for our economy, we got more of it than we could ever use! \n\nThe English, with their seemingly never-ending ship building, are paying ludicrious sums of money for lumber, and it has caused the Swedish Timber Industry to boom! Across the Kingdom, especially in the mostly unpopulated North, new steam-powered sawmills have begun to spring up in the hundreds. \nOur Export of lumber is going through the roof, and is projected to increase by several hundred percent in the coming months; Countless workers have found new well-paying, honest job in these sawmills. \nNot only is this helping reduce unemployment, but the tax revenue we are receiving from these Limber Companies is nothing short of jawdropping. \n\nSome of the Companies have started arguing that if they were to receive a tax cut, they could use that money to build even more mills and, in turn, employ even more workers. Doing this would surely upset some radicals however..."
 eoanb_sweden.3.a:0 "They deserve a tax cut for their hard work!"
 eoanb_sweden.3.b:0 "They are making billions in profits: They can afford to pay."
 
 eoanb_sweden.4.t:0 "Swedish Timber Boom"
 eoanb_sweden.4.d:0 "In the last few monnths, Sweden has been experiencing a lumber boom, the economic explosion is impacting the North of the Kingdom very strongly, with hundreds of sawmills being sprung up, employing thousands and paying millions in taxes. The Swedish Economy is thus experiencing a strong revitilisation. This boom has in large part been caused by our own massive demand for timber for shipbuilding, and the boom is very good news for Dockyards throughout the country. The massive increase in supply is driving down the cost of wood, and that is, in turn, allowing our dockyards to pump out new ships even quicker."
 eoanb_sweden.4.a:0 "Very good!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.5.t:0 "Long live the King"
 eoanb_sweden.5.d:0 "Earlier today, his Majesty King Oscar I passed away. \n\nHis Majesty has suffered from serious illnesses for the last 30 years, but through pure willpower has stayed alive. However, he never truly recovered from the death of his son Prince Gustaf six years ago. Since that traumatic event, he has been suffering severe memory loss, and after a stroke two years ago, he became paralyzed. At the recommendation of his Doctor, he stepped down from all public affairs shortly thereafter and appointed Crown Prince Charles to serve as the regent in his stead. After stepping down, it seemed like he was starting to recover, however, around one year ago, his health took a rapid turn for the worse. In the last few months he has been slipping in and out of consciousness, the once proud King having been reduced to an incoherent, shivering wreck. \n\nYesterday evening, his condition became critical, and his family quickly travelled to the Royal Palace to say their farewells. The autopsy revealed an egg-sized tumor inh is brain, which is the likely cause of death. \n\nThough his passing has not come as a great shock, it is regardless a great tradgedy, and the country is in mourning. \n\nCrown Prince Charles has assumed the official position of King of Sweden, and his coronation is scheduled for May next year."
 eoanb_sweden.5.a:0 "May he Rest in Peace."
 
 eoanb_sweden.6.t:0 "The S.W.A.F.D is founded!"
 eoanb_sweden.6.d:0 "The Swedish Women's Association for the Fatherlands Defense, or SWAFD for short, was founded earlier today in Stockholm. The association, with aims to start a grassroots movement to encourage patriotism and support for the Armed Forces, has already started the process of raising several hundred-thousand crowns to support the Army through lotteries and donations. \nIt's chairman, Lady Lotta von Plomgren, impassionately pleaded to the \"Daughters of the Fatherland to support its Defenders!\" in the Church of St. Nicholas in one of the numerous events to support the Army. \n\nThough some members of the Military feel bitter about receiving help from the lesser sex, there is no denying that the extra money and grassroots support will prove invaluable, both in terms of financing expansions, and finding new personell." 
 eoanb_sweden.6.a:0 "We are United in our struggle."
 eoanb_sweden.6.b:0 "Our Army needs no help."
 
 eoanb_sweden.7.t:0 "The Bessemer Process reaches Sweden!"
 eoanb_sweden.7.d:0 "The Bessemer Process, named after its inventor Henry Bessemmer has finally started to gain traction in Sweden! \n\nThe Process, which uses oxidation and other chemical reactions to make high-quality steel from cheap Pig Iron, has the potential to enable, for the first time in history, the ability to mass produce steel relatively cheaply. \n\nThough experiments with the process were initially unsuccessful in Sweden, businessman Pontus Kleman and Metallurgical Engineer Johan Leffler have managed to create the first successful Ironwork which utilizes the process. Though this is revolutionary, it is still met with some skepticism from larger Ironworks, who argue that this is Alchemy and Chrysopoeia all over again."
 eoanb_sweden.7.a:0 "Very impressive!"
 
 eoanb_sweden.8.t:0 "Louis de Geer enters the Stage"
 eoanb_sweden.8.d:0 "After much deliberation, his Majesty the King has appointed Louis Gerard De Geer av Finspång as the new Prime Minister of Sweden. Though the Conservatives hold control of both chambers of Parliament, with this appointment, the Liberals now have a fairly alarming amount of control over the country, occupying both the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, and, now, the Government as a whole. \n\nDe Geer was initially offered the post two years ago, but seeing how meteoric his career so far had been, he politely declined, waiting until he was more established in political circles before assuming such a prestigious office. \n\nWe can do naught but speculate about what the future holds for de Geer, but, he is wildly recognised as an excellent statesman and politician, and political experts predict that his appointment forebodes a time of change for Sweden, for better or worse."

Major General Daragan of the Volinsky Regiment rallied Russian Survivors from all across the city, even going as far as to arm the servants of the castle, anything to stop the Swedish soldiers. After a brief negotiation, however, General Daragan agreed to surrender his forces. The time was four minutes to ten in the evening, St. Petersburg had finally fallen. \n\nThough no one can foresee the future, Military Experts predict that it doesn't bode well for the Russian Empire. \nSome Swedish Militarists, emboldened by the victory, and confident in their ability to \"restore the Swedish Empire\" have even gone so far as to suggest that St. Petersburg should be renamed into \"Nöteborg\", as it was called before it was captured by Russia in 1704, causing a great many people to roll their eyes"

 eoanb_sweden.14.d:0 "After having spent several days fighting in the towns and palaces scattering the area surrounding the city, the Russian General Staff made the decision to abandon the region and retreat to St. Petersburg, with the Swedes in hot pursuit. \nFollowing the capture of the Nevsky District, Swedish Troops, spearheaded by a detachment of Grenadiers led by Colonel Hägerflycht, made a quick advance north. Though initially slowed down by Skirmish Fire from entrenched troops in several houses on Babushkina street, the Swedish Force eventually reached Bekhtereva Square. The threat of Swedes on their flanks forced Russian Units from all across the Frunzensky district to retreat towards the heart of the city. Despite this, however, their defensive positions in the Tsentralny and Admiralteysky districts soon proved untenable and the Russian Commanders decided to fall back to behind the Fontanka river. The Swedes wasted no time in the chase. \nHeavy fighting in the Field of Mars ensued, almost resembling a conventional linebattle as the two opposing sides drew up their formations across the field, however the Swedes managed to capture the Field of Mars and the Imperial Stables next to them. The Russian Regiments fell back to the Palace Square, forming up around the Alexander Column, determined to stop the Swedes from capturing the Hermitage or the Winter Palace. After the initial Swedish Attack was cut to pieces by concentrated rifle fire from the Hermitage Theatre, Colonel Hägerflycht brought up several artillery pieces to pound the Russian defenders into submission. In what was described as a “regrettable overreaction”  the Swedish Artillery hit the historic St. Isaac’s Cathedral in their barrage and reportedly killed several Priests. However, the artillery did succeed in finally breaking the Russian ramparts, clearing the way for an overwhelming assault, spearheaded by the Life Regiment Grenadiers. The Russian defiance in the Palace Square has been described, even by the Swedes, as \"heroic\", but in the end, the Russian Units in the square were wiped out. \nThe final battle took place in the Peter and Paul Fortress, a few hundred yards north of the Hermitage. Major General Daragan of the Volinsky Regiment rallied Russian Survivors, even going as far as to arm the servants of the castle, anything to stop the Swedish soldiers. Adjutant General Bergenstråhle, de-facto leader of the assault on the city, met with General Daragan to discuss the terms of the Russian Surrender. Though Daragan has planned to make a last stand he, for the sake of his men, agreed to Bergenstråhle’s terms; The Russian Troops still left in the city would be spared and allowed to return to their homes, as long as they vowed not to take up arms against Sweden again. The time was 10:23 PM, St. Petersburg had finally fallen. \n\nThough no one can foresee the future, Military Experts predict that it doesn't bode well for the Russian Empire. Some Swedish Militarists, emboldened by the victory, have even gone so far as to suggest that St. Petersburg should be renamed into \"Nöteborg\" as it was called before it was captured by Russia in 1704"
