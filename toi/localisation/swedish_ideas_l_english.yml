Not only that: The Swedish Army loses it’s core and the most significant portion of it’s Armed Forces. The Motherland is crushed, drowned in sorrow and lament over these irreplaceable concessions\" General Georg Carl von Döbeln \nThe loss of Finland to Russia in 1809 was a devastating blow to Swedish National Pride, and has made the general population extremely unwilling to ever enter a war again"

The Swedish Army is currently incapable of pursuing even limited wartime operations, and it will take significant efforts to change that"
