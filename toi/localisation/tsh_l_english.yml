 #####DECISIONS####
 TSH_category_bakumatsu_modernization:0 "The Modernization of the Shogunate"
 TSH_category_bakumatsu_modernization_desc:0 "For more than two centuries, Japan had sheltered itself sucessfully from the tumult of the outside world under the guise of its isolation policies. However, ever since the arrival of Commodore Perry and the signing of his Kangawa Treaty in 1854, Japan in its current state stands in a position of great weakness, unable to resist the demands of the Western technological giants who have already smited the great power that was once China. \n\nAlthough many of our people fear the West and deplore the idea of Westerners coming to our shores, it has come to the attention of some of our top advisors that if Japan is to survive the onslaught of the Western barbarians, it is urgent that we invest as many resources as possible into sponsoring foreign studies, both domestically and abroad, to ensure our national defense and the independence of our great realm."

 ####EVENTS####
 shogunate_japan.0.t:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan.0.d:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied the fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."
 shogunate_japan.0.a:0 "Hajime!"
 shogunate_japan.1.t:0 "The Harris Treaty"
 shogunate_japan.1.d:0 "An envoy from [USA.GetNameDef] by the name of Townsend Harris has once again approached the bakufu, seeking the ratification of a new, so-called Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan. \n \nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"
 shogunate_japan.1.a:0 "We must convince the Emperor to ratify."
 shogunate_japan.1.b:0 "Foreign policy is the Shogunate's responsibility."
 shogunate_japan.2.t:0 "The Emperor's Decision"
 shogunate_japan.2.d:0 "Despite our special envoy Lord Hotta Masayoshi's best efforts to convince Emperor Komei in his Kyoto court to accept the terms of the American unequal treaty, the Emperor firmly believes that no such deals should be made with barbarians as their presence on our isles would violate its sanctity. As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders. \n \nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the bakufu."
