This regular attendance, with lavish processions from and to the capital, was expensive and time consuming. In addition, the Daimyo's family would be held as hostages within the capital during the time they were away from the capital.

However, ever since the arrival of Commodore Perry and the signing of his Kanagawa Treaty in 1854, Japan in its current state stands in a position of great weakness, unable to resist the demands of the Western technological giants who have already smited the great power that was once China.\n\nAlthough many of our people fear the West and deplore the idea of Westerners coming to our shores, it has come to the attention of some of our top advisors that if Japan is to survive the onslaught of the Western barbarians, it is urgent that we invest as many resources as possible into sponsoring foreign studies, both domestically and abroad, to ensure our national defense and the independence of our great realm."

With no son of his own to take his place, a new heir must be found in one of the Tokugawa branch families.\n\nWhile it would be no issue to find an heir, it is an issue of who will be heir; there are various suggestions, but two stand out as the primary factions in the debate: §YTokugawa Yoshinobu§!, supported by reformists and Tokugawa Nariaki, and §YTokugawa Yoshitomi§!, supported by Bakufu supporters and Ii Naosuke."

 ####FOCUS EVENTS####
 shogunate_japan.0.t:0 "The Tokugawa Shogunate"
 shogunate_japan.0.d:0 "Ever since Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Japan entered into an era of unprecedented unity, stability, and progress under his new Shogunate. This era, dubbed the Edo Period after the bakufu capital, would see the beginnings of Japan's complete withdrawal from the outside world, save for brief contacts with China and Korea under the policy of sakoku, or closed country, enacted between 1633-1639. With its strong isolationist stance, Japan was able to resist the spread of Christianity and other Western influences within the country, maintaining its independence, at the cost of sealing off contact with modern innovations, save for a small Dutch trading post in the bay of Nagasaki called Dejima. Although contacts with the Dutch were limited, Japanese scholars were able to obtain a fair amount of knowledge on modern medicine and technology through the Rangaku studies, but the country as a whole still lagged far behind the West. \n \nThis 220-year paradigm, and the peace that came with it, suddenly came to a screeching halt when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry steamed into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853 and demanded that Japan end its long period of isolation and adopt formal trade relations with the US. To back up his demands were the might of his powerful steamships, which the Japanese called the black ships because of the color of the warships and the smoke that belched out of their coal-fired steam engines. The Shogunate, virtually threatened at gunpoint to end sakoku, finally agreed to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry on March 31, 1854. The terms of the Convention agreed to the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American vessels, ensured the safety of American castaways, and established an American consul in Japan. \n \nThe aftermath of the Convention would cast a huge shadow of doubt over the Shogun's historical responsibility to oppose Western encroachment into Japan, and it was the catalyst for the rise of the Sonno Joi movement, or the belief that the Shogun was no longer capable of resisting the West, and that the Emperor should be entrusted with such an important role. With the security of Japan deeply threatened, the Shogunate overturned many of its policies restricting its naval capabilities in 1855, and desperately sought to improve the strength of its defenses as quickly as possible. However, centuries of peace have atrophied the fighting capability of Japanese troops, and with growing discontent from the historically hostile tozama daimyo, the Shogunate is quickly approaching its day of reckoning..."
 shogunate_japan.0.a:0 "For whom does the wind blow?"
 shogunate_japan.1.t:0 "The Harris Treaty"
 shogunate_japan.1.d:0 "An envoy from [USA.GetNameDef] by the name of Townsend Harris has once again approached the Bakufu, seeking the ratification of a new, so-called Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Its contents include an exchange of diplomatic agents between the US and Japan, the additional opening of the ports of Kanagawa and Nagasaki to the existing ports of Shimoda and Hakodate agreed to be opened originally in the Convention of Kanagawa, to be effective July 4th 1859, extraterritoriality rights for their citizens, new fixed low import-export duties subject to international control, and the right of freedom of religious expression to US nationals in Japan.\n\nThese demands are much higher than the treaty signed with Commodore Perry in the past, and the sudden introduction of foreigners into the shogunal capital of Edo is bound to cause a great deal of socioeconomic instability. However, we are sadly in no real position to oppose these demands, and if we were to refuse this treaty we may end up the same way China did in their Opium War. Our only choice now is, should we bring this before the Emperor and convince him to ratify the treaty, or is the signature of a bakufu official enough?"

 shogunate_japan.2.d:0 "Despite our special envoy Lord Hotta Masayoshi's best efforts to convince Emperor Komei in his Kyoto court to accept the terms of the American unequal treaty, the Emperor firmly believes that no such deals should be made with barbarians as their presence on our isles would violate its sanctity. As our Emperor's understanding of these foreigners stems merely from ukiyo-e prints of Westerners depicted as deplorable demons, it is unlikely that the bakufu has any capability of convincing him to open our ports to their traders.\n\nAlthough the Shogun himself could still ratify the treaty, acceding to the Westerners' demands without Imperial support would certainly sow popular disapproval of the Bakufu."
 shogunate_japan.2.a:0 "We have no choice..."
 shogunate_japan.14.t:0 "Purchase of Foreign Treatises"
 shogunate_japan.14.d:0 "Although we have in the past sought to reject the infringing influences of the West, there is no denying that their ways of war, commerce and technology is superior to ours. Holding to the old ways is no longer enough to protect Japan's sacred soil, and we must make the effort learn the ways of the West if we desire remaining as masters of our own fate.\n\n"Rangaku"; foreigner studies, have long been present in our lands. Our previous approach have been detrimental to the nation's wellbeing. We shall continue Rangaku's legacy, and improve our understanding of the world; proudly shall Japan rise!"

 shogunate_japan.15.d:0 "A stench of death wafts coldly throughout the streets of Edo today...\n\nMany people considered the arrival of the Black Ships and their crews of bearded barbarians on our shores to be a sign of a bad omen, and recently many more have become more convinced of its fact. That the Shogun's allowance of the West to enter Japan, and the subsequent disasterous events in earthquakes and famines, were the anger of the Gods that the Shogun had so carelessly betrayed. Another omen has struck. In the many houses of the metropolis that is Edo, mothers, sons, daughters and fathers lie, dead or alive in their beds afflicted by another passenger of these Black Ships. The seat of shogunal power now houses another plague of the West: Cholera."

Despite being protected from outside interaction from an early age by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi, his body was frail and would later contract smallpox which further weakened his already shallow health.\n\nIt's currently undecided who will take over if the Shogun passes...

 shogunate_japan_l.1.d:0 "Due to the illness of the Shogun, and due to the inability for the Shogun to perform his duty in his best ability, Ii Naosuke has been selected to serve as as a temporary regent. The regent administration will remain in place until an heir has been selected, and a new Shogun is able to retake the reins of power. Some figures in court are protesting the selection of Ii as regent, outraged that someone with an obvious alliegance to a certain candidate could be selected to hold such a position of power without the expectation of abuse.\n\nRegardless, the Tairō takes the helm to continue the Bakufu administration's normal activities and relations."

 shogunate_japan_l.2.d:0 "With the Shogunate up for grabs for the most cunning and politically savy of people in the Tokugawa family, it's no wonder that both sides supporting each of their own heirs are trying their best to persuade Iesada and those who are close to him to select their candidate. Whichever candidate stands to gain favour, it is clear that they must both persuade the Shogun as much as put down the arguments of the opposing faction!"

 shogunate_japan_l.3.d:0 "What many have long expected or feared has now become a reality. The 13th Shogun of the Tokugawa Clan has passed on, losing what many saw as an inevitable battle against disease.\n\nThe procession and burial of the former Shogun's body was met with solemn but tense silence. Sorrow, emptiness, contempt, duty and plotting are all emotions and mindsets that fill the air during this moment. The Shogun's death has finally given justification in the question of who will take his place, and the supporters of each candidate knows of this fact very well; the Shogun died childless, and a new heir must be selected from the Tokugawa family to rule.\n\nIesada Shogun's death gave rise to two prominent factions that each supported a candidate that they would prefer to take the position of Shogun. Ii Naosuke, the Ōoku and the Bakufu are the main supporters of the youngest candidate, Tokugawa Yoshitomi in his bid to succeed Iesada. However, while there are many who support Yoshitomi's bid to the position, a second candidate has also come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim. Tokugawa Yoshinobu, son of Tokugawa Nariaki of Mito, a political opponent of Ii Naosuke, has come forth to contest Yoshitomi's claim and to make his own bid as Shogun. Yoshinobu is older than Yoshitomi, and has more experience as a leading figure, but his father's connections and support of the notion of imperial rule makes him a dubious candidate in the eyes of the Bakufu.\n\nWhoever takes power of the two will define the era of the Shogunate!"

After extensive efforts to convince Iesada of Iemochi's candidateship as the new Shogun, Iemochi was adopted into Iesada's family as his son and successor to the Shogunate. The former Shogun's passing has now given way for Iemochi to inherit his position as Shogun, much to the pleasure of Ii Naosuke and the Bakufu, and displeasure to Tokugawa Nariaki and supporters of rival candidate Yoshinobu. The seat of shogunal power is no longer vacant, and now Iemochi shall take his rightful place as the ruler of Japan!\n\nBanzai!"

 shogunate_japan_fl.0.d:0 "It would seem Takemikazuchi has let his guard down lately, letting the old and wild Namazu frolic and lash beneath the earth of Japan as they please...\n\nAn earthquake has struck Echizen Province! As the earth shook under the tremendous forces coming from Atotsugawa Fault, connecting Amō Pass with Tateyama, great destruction in the province struck! Tombiyama experienced a major landslide, trapping many souls living beneath her to choke on the rapidly decending soil and rock coming down the mountainside. The Jōganji River has been blocked significantly by debris from the destruction, and cleaning operations have been organized in a hurry to assist in clearing and helping people affected by this calamity."

 shogunate_japan_fl.1.t:0 "Attack on Russian sailors!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.d:0 "Yokohama was, prior to the entry of Commodore Perry's black ships, merely a small fishing village south of the Shogunal capital in Edo. However, the small village has shown a trend to grow rapidly in the wake of recent treaties with the Western powers, making the city a port open for powers that have signed treaties with us in the recent past.\n\nWhile most in the Bakufu believe that the opening of ports to appease Western interests, over outright rejecting them, was the lesser of two evils, many of our subjects are staunchly opposed to their incursion on national soil. This has now culminated into open-day attacks on foreigners, and the small fishing town of Yokohama has now become the site of the murder of two Russian sailors by rouge Samurai discontent with the Shogun's latest policies. The sailors were found bloodily in pieces, violently struck down by the blade of one or more Samurai. In the area more bodies were found, being of Chinese traders and native Japanese attendées serving Westerners.\n\nThe incident has spurred both the anger of the Russian embassy and the cheers of treaty opponents. The Russian minister demands that the perpetrators be caught and handed over for judgement, and for the local garrison to prevent such attacks occurring in the future."
 shogunate_japan_fl.1.a:0 "What!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.t:0 "Attack on Dutch captains!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.d:0 "Another attack on foreigners in Yokohama has occurred!\n\nToday, two Dutch captains were found dead on the streets of Yokohama after another assault by rouge Samurai. Tensions within the country has been high since the opening of the nation to the outside world and the barbarian Westerners, and the public upheval over the Shogunate's decision to fold in the face of the Western might has only stoked that tension further. Today marks another expression of that tension as the two captains were cut down around the Yokohama harbour, much like the previous murder on two Russian sailors. The Dutch were quick to lodge a complaint over the incident, but were quickly addressed with promises to capture the perpetrators.\n\nThe discontent over the state of the Shogunate is spreading further within Japan, and the people are fiercly debating the proper course of action which the nation should take in relation to these Westerners. Things are undecided and small now, but soon there may come a time when the fate of the Shogunate must be decided."
 shogunate_japan_fl.2.a:0 "Another one!?"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.t:0 "Attack on a French minister servant!"
 shogunate_japan_fl.3.d:0 "A new attack on a foreigner has occurred!\n\nThis time a servant of the French minister in Japan was attacked, but not killed. The servant was wounded by discontent Samurai, but before they could finish the job, the other servants as well as the local garrison and minister retinue interfered. The rouge attacker fled the scene when the pressure mounted, but was later captured.\n\nThe incident marks the third attack within a year, and murmurs among the Western dignitaries speak of moving more guards into Yokohama to protect their officials. It would seem that their patience is running thin. Things are calm for now, but if another incident like this should occur, then it is likely that a simple apology will not suffice..."

 tsh_news.0.t:0 "Tokugawa Iemochi is selected as Shogun"
 tsh_news.0.d:0 "A new Shogun now sits on the throne in the old shogunal seat of power in Edo!\n\nThe new Shogun, Iemochi, takes the seat of power at a young, young age of 12 years old. As it is not expected that someone of such a young age can rule a nation without great ability or great difficulty, the young Shogun will be supervised by great elder and acting regent Ii Naosuke and others. They will manage and rule in the stead of the Shogun until the young boy has learned more and come of age, in time for when he must fulfill his duty as Shogun.\n\nHis selection as Shogun has been met with mixed reactions from the Japanese people. While there are some who rejoice over the arrival of a new leader to guide them in these uncertain times for Japan, there are many dissenting voices that still speak of the weakness of the former Shogun and the Shogunate's inability to protect Japan from foreign invaders. It remains to be seen how Shogun Iemochi's rule will shape Japan and her future in the coming years, but now the winds of change will blow Japan across the ocean of time, and into the star-filled horizon of promise that is the future."

 POLITICAL_DESC_TOKUGAWA_IESADA:0 "Born to weak health, Tokugawa Iesada was early in his life sheltered from the outside world to protect his health, and to make sure the only son and heir of Ieyoshi Shogun could grow up to rule after him.\n\nIesada's rule has seen Japan be forced to open up to the outside world, and many catastrophic natural disasters that has ruined many cities and lives. His lack of participation in court life and rule of the Bakufu, paired with these disasters, have made his rule very unpopular among the common people. His percieved weakness and failure to protect Japan from foreign incursions have allowed his opponents to get the upper-hand. The rule of the Shogun is fading..."
